      "Plastic waste accumulation in the environment is an exponentially growing problem that needs to be urgently addressed to avoid the catastrophic damage of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. In this work, currently undervalued plastic carbon content was aimed to be exploited by converting it into triglycerides (TGs), following a two-stage approach. Polyethylene (PE) was first treated by hydrothermal processing (HTP) to obtain PE oils that were later used as carbon source for fermentation with Yarrowia lipolytica and transformed into TGs. HTP PE oil obtained at 425ÂºC for 120 min was found as an optimal carbon source for the biotechnological stage. Under these optimized conditions, 75% of PE mass was transformed into a PE oil that could be used by Yarrowia as carbon source to grow and produce TGs. An oil concentration of 15 g/l in fermentation media in the biotechnological stage improved fermentation performance as well in comparison to 10 g/l concentration: biomass growth and TGs production yield were increased by 130% regarding the control. Thereby, an alternative approach towards turning one of the most widespread plastics as PE into TGs is proposed in this work.\n"

For PP degradation, the non - acidic Ti - MCM41 and the Fe - ZSM - 5 samples produced liquid hydrocarbons with yields about 90 %. Similar results have been obtained for PS degradation, however, the activity of the catalyst with small pore sizes ( ZSM - 5 ) have had lower activity ( no reaction observed below 350Â°C ). The degradation of PVC takes place in two steps, the first is the release of HCl at about 300Â°C followed by formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Minimal residue could be obtained over Fe, Mg, Al - and Ca, MgAl - mixed oxide catalyst. From the results obtained it can be concluded that not only the catalyst structure but also the polymer structure determines the activity of a micro - or mesoporous material in the catalytic degradation of plastics or plastic wastes.

Similar results have been obtained for PS degradation, however, the activity of the catalyst with small pore sizes ( ZSM - 5 ) have had lower activity ( no reaction observed below 350Â°C ).

Furthermore, lignin - derived monomers, including phenol, o - cresol, and guaiacol, were also used as model feedstock for the catalytic co - pyrolysis in order to study the mechanism underlying aromatic formation. The mechanistic study helped lay theoretical foundation for the industrial application of the co - pyrolysis process. The effects of catalyst and waste cooking oil addition on co - pyrolysis product fractional yield and selectivity were studied. High amount of waste cooking oil in the feedstock with appropriate catalyst - to - feedstock ratio ( 3 : 1 ) contributed to high peak - area yields of the total detected compounds and aromatics. The alkylation and demethoxylation of phenols were enhanced at high ratios of catalyst to feedstock and waste cooking oil to lignin. When the ratio of waste cooking oil to lignin was 1 : 1, the highest mono - aromatic selectivity ( 82. 6 % ) and synergistic extent ( 52. 1 % ) for mono - aromatic production were obtained.

Characteristics of syngas from the gasification of blends were conducted using a fixed - bed reactor in CO2 atmosphere at 800 and 900 Â°C. Gasification behavior was examined with focus on evolved flow rate of H2, CO, total hydrocarbons ( CmHn ), and total syngas yield at the two temperatures for different blend ratios. CO2 consumption under the gasification conditions was evaluated. Gas yield efficiency and energy recovered in gasification were also calculated and compared. Synergistic effects in the syngas yield and the role of waste tire and pine bark were analyzed by a direct comparison of the results on experimental yields from WT - PB blends as compared to the correspondingly calculated aggregate results from the gasification of separate feedstock components at 800 Â°C and 900 Â°C. Results showed that increase in pine bark ratio increased peak flow - rate of H2, CO, total syngas, but decreased peak flow - rate of CmHn at the two temperatures. The syngas yield of gases at 900 Â°C were higher than that at 800 Â°C for a given blend ratio. The peak value of temporal CO2 consumption coincided with the peaks of CO yield for all the feedstocks except for pure waste tire at 800 Â°C and 900 Â°C.

The digestion process yielded a product with a high biogas content, rich in methane and hydrogen. The treatment with ratio of 0. 08 resulted in a production of 1384 mL biogas per gram of VS removed.

The maximum VS removal values found were greater than 85 % in the 0. 08 treatment and greater than 90 % in the 0. 04 treatment. The digestion process yielded a product with a high biogas content, rich in methane and hydrogen. The treatment with ratio of 0. 08 resulted in a production of 1384 mL biogas per gram of VS removed. The results of the biogas analysis showed up to 44 % hydrogen content in the acidogenic phase and 87 % methane after stabilization of the methanogenic phase. The data from the 0. 04, 0. 08, and 0. 20 treatments were fitted to the bisigmoidal model, using an equation adapted from the Gompertz function.

Workability and Compressive / Split tensile strength tests alongside microstructural and thermogravimetric analysis were performed. Results disclosed that the concrete â s workability increased with increasing percentages of PET. The compressive strength increases with extended curing but decreases as the percentages of waste PET increased at different curing lengths. The PET - modified blends could not yield the target design strength for grade 25 concrete after 28 days. However, the 20 % PET - modified mix reached the target strength for concrete grade 20. For all blends, increase in split tensile strength with curing lengths was observed, only the 20 % PET - modified blend achieved suitable split tensile strength values. Microstructural analysis revealed that the 100 % PET sample has a relatively irregular surface pattern with pores of about 2 â 4 Âµm, high quantities of Ca, and minor traces of O, C, Al, Si, Mg, and Na. While PC - 20 had a much denser interface between the PET aggregates and the cement matrix with high percentage of Si, O, and Ca, and moderate to minor percentage of Al, Au, Na, and Mg. Thermal analysis showed that the 100 % PET sample endured three transition stages. The research outcomes prove that heat - processed PET - modified concrete is suitable for structural applications due to its acceptable fresh, mechanical, microstructural, and thermal properties\n",

Results showed that pine and PE co - pyrolysis significantly decreased oxygen content from 23. 4 % ( pine only ) to 0. 3 % ( pine + PE / HZSM - 5 ), which increased products â HHV from 25. 9 MJ / kg to 34. 4 MJ / kg. It also revealed that the pine and PE ratio did not heavily influence the petrochemical concentration ( aromatic hydrocarbons + alkenes ( C â¤ 15 ) + alkanes ( C â¤ 13 ) ). However, a higher plastic ratio led to a higher wax production, which is the reason for poor condensation performance in condenser bio - oil capture. A pinewood sawdust to PE ratio of 3 : 1 showed the most higher - level petrochemicals and least amount of wax formation. Pine and PET co - pyrolysis produced significantly less wax and similar aromatic hydrocarbons to pine and PE co - pyrolysis.

As one of the main drawbacks of wood plastic composites and natural fibre reinforced plastics is the moisture gain, water uptake tests were carried out in order to quantify the effectiveness of the hydrophobization process with palmitoyl chloride. Results show a slight increase in flexural modulus for composites with both untreated and treated / compatibilized SCG powder ( 20 wt. % ). As expected, thermal stability is improved as indicated by an increase of more than 8 % in the onset degradation\n",

The effect of residence time during fast pyrolysis ( Isothermal ) in Pyro - GC was also investigated. Initially, TG analysis was performed to investigate the degradation temperature range at different heating rates of 5, 10, 20 and 40 Â°C / min. Two different heating rates of 10 and 20 Â°C / min were selected for examining the effect on products such as oil and gases ( H2, CO, CO2 and C1 - C6 hydrocarbons ) during slow pyrolysis. The oil obtained at higher heating rate had higher density ( 0. 743 kg / m3 ) while the amount of residue decreased with the increase in heating rate. Also, the effect of residence time during fast pyrolysis was investigated using Pyro - GC at 500 Â°C for the product formation. It was observed that an optimum residence time of 10sec was favourable for the higher production of lower hydrocarbons ( C1 - C3 ) and less production of heavier hydrocarbons ( C6 ).

      "['pyrolysis', 'binary pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis process'] pyrolysis of polystyrene ( PS ) with low - density polyethylene ( LDPE ), high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ), polypropylene ( PP ), poly - ethylene terephthalate ( PET ) plastics were carried out in a 25 cm3 stainless steel micro reactor at around 430 â 440 Â°C under 5. 5 â 6. 0 MPa of N2 gas pressure for 1 h. Three reactions of each plastic with PS were conducted in the ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The amount of PS was varied to explore its role and reactivity. In all coprocessing reactions, ratio 1 : 1 afforded the best yields in the form pyrolytic oils. SIM distillation of hexane soluble portion showed that the low boiling fractions were not found and fractions were obtained only after 96 Â°C + boiling point. It could be due to the vaporization of high volatile components. In most of the binary pyrolysis, light cycle oil ( LCO ) fractions have low recovery than heavy cycle oil ( HCO ).

In degradation of PE, the acidic H - ZSM - 5 resulted in less liquid products and more gaseous components than the other, transition metal containing catalysts. For PP degradation, the non - acidic Ti - MCM41 and the Fe - ZSM - 5 samples produced liquid hydrocarbons with yields about 90 %. Similar results have been obtained for PS degradation, however, the activity of the catalyst with small pore sizes ( ZSM - 5 ) have had lower activity ( no reaction observed below 350Â°C ). The degradation of PVC takes place in two steps, the first is the release of HCl at about 300Â°C followed by formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Minimal residue could be obtained over Fe, Mg, Al - and Ca, MgAl - mixed oxide catalyst. From the results obtained it can be concluded that not only the catalyst structure but also the polymer structure determines the activity of a micro - or mesoporous material in the catalytic degradation of plastics or plastic wastes. Therefore, different optimal conditions ( catalyst and reaction temperature ) can be applied for each plastics studied ( pure, mixed and waste ) in thermal treatment\n",

It was found that the Y type zeolite supported nickel catalyst possessed narrower pores than the other catalysts, which in turn, promoted coke deactivation of the catalyst. Large amounts of filamentous carbons were observed on the surface of the Ni / Y - zeolite - 30 catalyst from scanning electron microscope images. In addition, the influence of Si : Al molar ratio for the Ni / ZSM - 5 catalysts in relation to hydrogen and syngas yield was investigated. The results indicated that hydrogen production was less affected by the Si : Al ratio than the type of zeolite support. Also, the Ni / ZSM5 - 30 catalyst was further investigated to determine the influence of different process parameters on hydrogen and syngas yield via different reforming temperatures ( 650, 750, 850 Â°C ) and steam feeding rate ( 0, 3, 6 g hâ1 ).

However, given that this is an emerging technology not yet used widely in practice, it is not clear if pyrolysis of waste plastics is sustainable on a life cycle basis and how it compares to other plastics waste management options as well as to the production of virgin plastics. Therefore, this study uses life cycle assessment ( LCA ) to compare the environmental impacts of chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste ( MPW ) via pyrolysis with the established waste management alternatives : mechanical recycling and energy recovery. Three LCA studies have been carried out under three perspectives : waste, product and a combination of the two. To ensure robust comparisons, the impacts have been estimated using two impact assessment methods : Environmental footprint and ReCiPe. The results suggest that chemical recycling via pyrolysis has a 50 % lower climate change impact and life cycle energy use than the energy recovery option. The climate change impact and energy use of pyrolysis and mechanical recycling of MPW are similar if the quality of the recyclate is taken into account. Furthermore, MPW recycled by pyrolysis has a significantly lower climate change impact ( â0. 45 vs 1. 89 t CO2 eq. / t plastic ) than the equivalent made from virgin fossil resources.

       "{'context': 'In this work, a hibonite-type Ni/La-hexaaluminate (Ni/LHA) synthesized from an industrial waste is used and compared as catalyst in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 973 K. The structure, catalytic behavior, and stability during a run time of at least 50 h of three Ni-catalysts obtained from two commercial supports and two preparation methods were used for comparison. An aluminum solution (9.40 g/L) obtained from an aluminum saline slag waste by acid extraction was used to synthesize the hexaaluminate by mixing with a stoichiometric amount of lanthanum nitrate and methanol/Peg400/PegMn400 under hydrothermal conditions at 493 K for 16 h. The Ni/LHA catalyst (10 wt% NiO) was obtained by impregnation of the synthesized support, calcined previously at 1473 K for 2 h. The resulting solids were characterized by several techniques as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption at 77 K, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). In order to compare the catalytic behavior and properties of the Ni/LHA catalyst, three Ni catalysts obtained from two commercial supports (Î³-Al2O3 and SiO2) and two preparation methods (wet impregnation (I) and precipitation-deposition (PD)) were synthesized. Analysis of the TPR patterns for the catalysts allowed the type of metal support interaction and NiO species to be determined, with a weak interaction with the support being observed in Ni/LHA and NiâI/SiO2. The NiO species observed, with crystallite sizes between 9.7 and 40.4 nm, confirm the X-ray structural analyses. The Ni/LHA catalyst was found to be active and very stable in the DRM reaction after 50 h. The catalytic behavior was evaluated from the CO2 and CH4 conversions, as well as the H2/CO selectivity, with values of 99% over almost all the time range evaluated. The behavior of this catalyst is comparable to that of NiâI/Al2O3 and Ni-PD/SiO2. The results found indicating that the strong interaction of nickel with the support favors the stability of the catalysts in the DRM reaction.',\n",
