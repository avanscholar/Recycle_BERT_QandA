      "Along with the increasing amount of plastic production and waste disposal, the presence of microplastics has been confirmed in all compartments of ecosystems. The microplastics in biota is of particular concern due to the potential eco-risks associated with long term exposure and the potential for transportation along food webs. Decapoda represents a diverse taxonomic group within the subphylum Crustacea, and some of which are highly valued in fishery and biological production. The interaction between microplastic pollution and wild populations of decapod crustaceans have been documented less than fish or bivalves but are critical to understand the fates of microplastics in marine eco-systems and enrich the baselines for consumption analyses. Our review systematically summarizes the occurrence, abundance and characteristics of microplastics detected in edible and non-edible sections of decapod crustaceans from field observations. Sub-groups between crabs and shrimps were also included for comparison. The occurrence of microplastics in the edible sections were less than those in non-edible sections, and there are differences between crabs and shrimps. Fibrous microplastics and items with a size category less than 1 mm were dominant pollutants across all available literature. The methodology selection, biological features and uptake pathways play roles in the microplastic body burden in Decapoda. Our work enriches the understanding of microplastic pollution in wild populations of decapod crustaceans but their contribution to the human exposure to microplastics needs to be addressed with more accurate measurements.\n"

This article will provide a critical review about the recovery pathways of plastic pyrolysis based on the various products ( fuels, naphtha, hydrogen, and light olefins ).

      "Prediction: ['fuel oil', 'fuel oil using Al – Si catalysts derived from cogon grass. The study consisted of three stages. The first stage determined the composition of the waste plastics found in Sichang Island. High - density polyethylene ( 48 % ) comprised the highest proportion of the waste plastics, followed by low - density polyethylene ( 22 % ), polyethylene terephthalate ( 13 % ), polypropylene ( 10 % ), and polystyrene ( 7 % ). In the second stage, the Al – Si catalysts were prepared from cogon grass ( Imperata cylindrica ( L. ) Beauv ) by treating it with acid and calcination. The optimum conditions to extract silica from cogon grass through acid treatment were heating at 700 °C for 2 h, which yielded 97. 7 % of amorphous silica with a surface area of 172 m2 / g and a pore volume of 0. 43 cc / g. This amorphous silica was combined with an aluminum precursor to form Al – Si catalysts with 20 – 80 wt % of Al – Si. The results showed that the surface area of the catalyst increased with increasing aluminum content. The optimum ratio was 60 wt % of Al – Si with a surface area of 200 m2 / g. In the final stage, the catalytic properties of the previously prepared Al – Si catalysts in the pyrolysis of waste plastics were evaluated. The catalyst enhanced the plastic cracking process and the oil yield', 'oil yield']\n",

Waste oils are the optimal raw materials to produce biofuels due to their high hydrogen and volatile matter content. However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament.

Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio - oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA - 15 @ MgO @ Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio - oil. Moreover, co - pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio - oil yield and quality.
