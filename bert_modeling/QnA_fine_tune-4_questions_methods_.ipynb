      "Recovering waste plastics by catalytic fast pyrolysis to selectively generate aromatic hydrocarbons is a promising approach to dispose of solid wastes. In the present work, catalytic conversion of polystyrene over ultra-stable Y zeolites (USY) was conducted to directionally produce benzene and ethylbenzene. Experimental results indicated that catalyst type considerably affected the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and USY with high surface area (734 m2/g), large pore size (5.6 nm), and an abundant amount of strong acid sites (1.21 mmol/g) exhibited the most effective shape selectivity for ethylbenzene and benzene generation as the yield enhanced rate reached 401.8% and 61.1%, respectively. Plastic type also played a vital role in the formation of desirable aromatic hydrocarbons, and polystyrene was more beneficial to the production of ethylbenzene as a 54-fold increase was obtained compared to polycarbonate in the catalytic degradation process. Concerning reaction conditions to maximize the formation of benzene and ethylbenzene in the catalytic decomposition of polystyrene, the catalyst/feedstock mass ratio, Si/Al mole ratio in USY, and catalytic conversion temperature could be optimized at 1.5, 5.3, and 650 °C, respectively.\n"

In this scenario, the largest concern is the feasibility. Are plastic waste pyrolysis products acceptable steam cracking feedstocks in terms of composition, product yields and coke formation? In this work, steam cracking of two post - consumer plastic waste pyrolysis oils blended with fossil naphtha was performed in a continuous bench - scale unit without prior treatment. Product yields and radiant coil coke formation were benchmarked to fossil naphtha as an industrial feedstock. Additionally, the plastic waste pyrolysis oils were thoroughly characterized. Analyses included two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector for the detailed hydrocarbon composition as well as specific analyses for heteroatoms, halogens and metals. It was found that both pyrolysis oils are rich in olefins ( [UNK] wt % ) and that the main impurities are nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, aluminum, calcium and sodium. Steam cracking of the plastic waste derived feedstocks led to ethylene yields of [UNK] wt % at a coil outlet temperature of 820 °C and [UNK] wt % at 850 °C, exceeding the ethylene yield of pure naphtha at both conditions ( [UNK] wt % and [UNK] wt %, respectively ).

However, given that this is an emerging technology not yet used widely in practice, it is not clear if pyrolysis of waste plastics is sustainable on a life cycle basis and how it compares to other plastics waste management options as well as to the production of virgin plastics. Therefore, this study uses life cycle assessment ( LCA ) to compare the environmental impacts of chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste ( MPW ) via pyrolysis with the established waste management alternatives : mechanical recycling and energy recovery. Three LCA studies have been carried out under three perspectives : waste, product and a combination of the two. To ensure robust comparisons, the impacts have been estimated using two impact assessment methods : Environmental footprint and ReCiPe. The results suggest that chemical recycling via pyrolysis has a 50 % lower climate change impact and life cycle energy use than the energy recovery option. The climate change impact and energy use of pyrolysis and mechanical recycling of MPW are similar if the quality of the recyclate is taken into account. Furthermore, MPW recycled by pyrolysis has a significantly lower climate change impact ( −0. 45 vs 1. 89 t CO2 eq. / t plastic ) than the equivalent made from virgin fossil resources. However, pyrolysis has significantly higher other impacts than mechanical recycling, energy recovery and production of virgin plastics.

The distilled fraction was characterised and compared to pyrolysis oil in terms of its physicochemical properties and composition. Analysis by gas - chromatography / mass - spectrometry ( GC - MS ) revealed high levels of aromatics, namely styrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and α - methylstyrene, which are potentially recoverable base compounds for industrial use.

In that frame, the influence of temperature ( 550°C or 600°C ) on the pyrolysis of pure polypropylene ( PP ), polyethylene ( PE ), polystyrene ( PS ) and polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) was first studied. It is shown that whatever the type of polymer, aromatic compounds are mainly formed and could reach 55wt. - % of the oil fraction for PP and 31wt. - % for PE at 550°C. In a second step, a PP / PE mixture and a model mixture representative of the packaging plastic waste stream were pyrolyzed to investigate the influence of a combination of polymers on the proportions and composition of the different fractions. The pyrolysis of the polymer mixtures shows that, even if the aromatic compounds formed are similar to those obtained for the virgin polymers, the proportion of aromatic compounds is much more important than when the polymers are pyrolyzed alone. Indeed, mixing PE with PP at a 50 / 50 ratio does not affect the amount of liquid, gas and solid fractions but leads to the formation of a higher quantity of xylene ( 39 wt - % ) at 550°C. The combination of the plastics in the model mixture has also led to a decrease of the amount of waxy compounds. Furthermore, it was shown that a higher amount of aromatics than expected was formed. As a conclusion, this study demonstrates that pyrolysis is an effective technique to recover plastic waste as aromatic compounds for the petroleum industry.

The objective of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of converting post - consumer plastics to fuel or oil using pyrolysis, and to assess the processing and market conditions required for a successful deployment of pyrolysis technologies. The economic feasibility of converting plastic waste to oil / fuel using pyrolysis is evaluated using as criteria the net present value ( NPV ) and internal rate of return ( IRR ). The Lang factor method is used to estimate the cost of the plant ( capital and operating cost ). Capital expenditures ( CapEx ), operating expenses ( OpEx ), and revenue generated by the sale of product are estimated.

The objective of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of converting post - consumer plastics to fuel or oil using pyrolysis, and to assess the processing and market conditions required for a successful deployment of pyrolysis technologies. The economic feasibility of converting plastic waste to oil / fuel using pyrolysis is evaluated using as criteria the net present value ( NPV ) and internal rate of return ( IRR ). The Lang factor method is used to estimate the cost of the plant ( capital and operating cost ). Capital expenditures ( CapEx ), operating expenses ( OpEx ), and revenue generated by the sale of product are estimated. US market conditions ( i. e., feedstock cost, feedstock transportation cost, volume of feedstock available, taxes, wages, tipping fees ) are taken into account in estimating operational costs. The plants were evaluated at three scales : 30 tons per day ( TPD ), 60 TPD, and 100 TPD, each with the option of sourcing feedstock at the current market price ( Case 1 ) or at no cost ( Case 2 ).

Our results revealed that the tensile strength and flexural strength of the ISCSP / PLA composites reached 58. 71 and 90. 11 MPa, which were 28. 6 % and 28. 8 % higher than that of pure PLA, respectively. The glass transition and melting temperatures of the composites remained similar to those of pure PLA. Interestingly, the addition of CSP increased PLA crystallinity, which could be attributed to the nucleation effect of CSP in the system. The antibacterial activity of the PLA - 1. 5ESCSP composite samples against Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) was greater than 99 %. More importantly, the live / dead assay showed that the CSP / PLA composites possessed excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the developed CSP / PLA biocomposites are potential feedstocks for 3D printing in bone tissue engineering and may be used as graft substitutes in reparative and reconstructive surgery.

As such, it promises to deliver a cost - effective, sustainable solution to a high volume of waste for value added applications. The key process used in this study to tailor the molecular recycling process was selective high temperature transformation. This was achieved with two waste sources : waste coffee grounds as a source of carbon, and mixed automotive waste glasses as a source of silicon. These two sources were used to produce high - value SiC nanowires of 50 – 100 nm diameter with surface area of ~ 64. 21 m2 / g.

A dissolution pre - treatment step dissolved the high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) in recycled pyrolysis wax to create a liquid feed to the pyrolysis reactor, avoiding clogging and bridging of the plastic particles that is common in alternative feeding strategies. Three different reactor volumes were tested to determine the effect of residence time on product distribution. Pyrolysis products were cooled through a series of two condenser to separate the products into three groups : a heavy, waxy product ( > C15 ), a lighter liquid product ( C6 - C15 ), and a gaseous product ( C1 - C6 ). GC / MS analysis was used to characterize the composition of each product. Multiphysics modeling was conducted to estimate the residence time in the reactor and compare the pilot plant results to previously published micropyrolysis research. It was found that residence time had a significant effect on product distribution, with an increase from 1 to 4. 5 s of residence time causing a 9 wt % drop in wax ( C20 - C30 ) production and a 11 wt % increase in light oil ( C5 - C10 ) production.

A dissolution pre - treatment step dissolved the high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) in recycled pyrolysis wax to create a liquid feed to the pyrolysis reactor, avoiding clogging and bridging of the plastic particles that is common in alternative feeding strategies. Three different reactor volumes were tested to determine the effect of residence time on product distribution. Pyrolysis products were cooled through a series of two condenser to separate the products into three groups : a heavy, waxy product ( > C15 ), a lighter liquid product ( C6 - C15 ), and a gaseous product ( C1 - C6 ). GC / MS analysis was used to characterize the composition of each product. Multiphysics modeling was conducted to estimate the residence time in the reactor and compare the pilot plant results to previously published micropyrolysis research. It was found that residence time had a significant effect on product distribution, with an increase from 1 to 4. 5 s of residence time causing a 9 wt % drop in wax ( C20 - C30 ) production and a 11 wt % increase in light oil ( C5 - C10 ) production. The trends for product distribution as a function of residence time were found to be consistent between both the pilot plant and micropyrolysis systems, demonstrating that the pilot plant system can be “ tuned ” to produce the desired pyrolysis product\n",

Therefore, a direct recycling and reusing of these wastes as green construction material can potentially reduce the environmental burden. Considering plastic and rubber are both synthesized polymer materials containing similar basic elements with distinct structures, this paper aims to comparatively review the functions and impacts of plastic and rubber wastes used as eco - friendly aggregates on the fresh and hardened properties as well as the durability performance in mortar and concrete. The type and source of plastic and rubber wastes used as aggregate, as well as their effects in terms of aggregate size, replacement content, shape and treatment method are highlighted. In general, the presence of plastic aggregate decreases the workability of concrete, while the effect of rubber aggregate is mainly governed by the size and replacement content. Also, the smooth surface and low specific gravity of plastic / rubber aggregate compared to natural aggregate increased the pore structure which reduced the matrix density and mechanical strength. Nevertheless, chemical treatment of rubber aggregate was found to be an efficient and feasible method to compensate the mechanical strength loss of rubber incorporated concrete.

MWW and MFI ( 12 and 10 member ring structures respectively ) type zeolites having different pore structure and acidity were used for catalytic cracking of polymer feed at 350 °C. Investigations revealed that MWW type zeolite having two independent pore channels selectively provides gasoline range of hydrocarbons ( C7 – C12, 99. 12 % ) in polymer cracking reaction as compared to MFI type which results in C13 – C20 range of hydrocarbons ( 73. 19 % ). Hydrocarbon compositions were confirmed from GC - MS, 1H, 13C NMR and FT - IR techniques. In activity results it was observed that acidity of zeolites affects the liquid yield and hydrocarbon distribution as analysed by using zeolites of two different SiO2 / Al2O3 ( SAR ) ratio ( 30 and 55 ) which directs that zeolite ( MFI / MWW ) with lower SAR ( 30 ) having higher acidity results in higher yield of fuel range liquid hydrocarbons as compared to higher SAR ( 55 ) zeolite. Characterization studies such as XRD, N2 - physisorption, NH3 - TPD, FE - SEM and EDX were performed to check the physiochemical properties of zeolite and correlated with the activity. Overall, the present investigation provides detailed comparative study on plastic degradation\n",

To assess its applicability in the road sector, the base bitumen and R - LLDPE modified bitumen blends were compared through physical, chemical, rheological and thermal evaluation.

The proportion of PHB blended with used PE at 15 % ( 15 g U / PE, 3 g PHB, and 2 g plasticizer ) in the blends gave the highest maximum tensile strength. The water absorption for all the U / PHB blends was higher compared to the UPE and PHB blended.

      "['pyrolysis', 'thermal', 'low ER autothermal decomposition'] pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion. A three - dimensional computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) model was developed for the simulation of SRF gasification process in a bubbling fluidized bed ( BFB ). The gas phase and solid phase were studied using the large eddy simulation ( LES ) approach and the multiple particle - in - cell ( MP - PIC ) method, respectively. The simulation included the chemical kinetic model of SRF drying, pyrolysis, gas – solid reactions, and homogeneous reactions. The kinetic chemistry model was expanded to reflect a higher yield of C2 - C3 gases and tars evolved from SRF. The simulation results were compared with the gas composition obtained from experiments conducted on a lab - scale reactor having a capacity, height, and internal diameter of 1 kg / h, 1 m, and 0. 114 m, respectively. The independence of the accuracy of the model on the mesh resolution and computational particle number was examined. Varying air - to - fuel equivalence ratio ( ER ) to 0. 20, 0. 25, and 0. 30 changed syngas LHV to 25. 40, 16. 86, and 14. 30 kJgas / gfuel respectively and changed C2 - C3 hydrocarbons yield to 0. 30, 0. 18, and 0. 16 g / gfuel respectively. Changing the SRF feed location to below the bed at ER = 0. 25, increased the gas LHV to 19. 85 kJgas / gfuel and increased C2 - C3 hydrocarbons yield to 0. 21.

The physical and chemical properties of the pit sand, sea sand, plastic wastes, and pavement block were determined. The FTIR identified Quartz and Kaoline minerals as the main components of the sand samples, whereas those of the plastic wastes were polyethylene and polypropylene. The SEM showed that the plastic - pit sand pavement block ( PPPB ) had fibrous surface with smaller pore volume and grain size than the plastic - sea sand pavement block ( PSPB ). At 20 % plastic composition, the water absorptivity of PPPB and PSPB maximized at 3. 98 % and 4. 60 %, respectively. Larger quantity of plastic decreased the block water absorptivity but improved the compressive strength. The maximum compressive strengths of the PPPB and PSPB were 36. 96 N / mm2 and 27. 81 N / mm2, respectively. The maximum tensile strength of PPPB ( 8. 2 N / mm2 ) exceeded the PSPB ( 6. 1 N / mm2 ). Furthermore, increasing the plastic composition improved the average penetration resistance of both pavement blocks. The results suggest that converting plastic wastes into pavement blocks is feasible, and can help reduce the rapid accumulation of plastic wastes in Ghana\n",

The physical and chemical properties of the pit sand, sea sand, plastic wastes, and pavement block were determined. The FTIR identified Quartz and Kaoline minerals as the main components of the sand samples, whereas those of the plastic wastes were polyethylene and polypropylene. The SEM showed that the plastic - pit sand pavement block ( PPPB ) had fibrous surface with smaller pore volume and grain size than the plastic - sea sand pavement block ( PSPB ). At 20 % plastic composition, the water absorptivity of PPPB and PSPB maximized at 3. 98 % and 4. 60 %, respectively. Larger quantity of plastic decreased the block water absorptivity but improved the compressive strength. The maximum compressive strengths of the PPPB and PSPB were 36. 96 N / mm2 and 27. 81 N / mm2, respectively. The maximum tensile strength of PPPB ( 8. 2 N / mm2 ) exceeded the PSPB ( 6. 1 N / mm2 ). Furthermore, increasing the plastic composition improved the average penetration resistance of both pavement blocks. The results suggest that converting plastic wastes into pavement blocks is feasible, and can help reduce the rapid accumulation of plastic wastes in Ghana\n",

For pyrolysis of mulching film waste or cattle excreta, an increase in temperature increased the yield of non - condensables and decreased the yield of condensables or solid residue. The mulching film waste - derived pyrolytic product was composed largely of a wide range of hydrocarbons ( C1 – C44 ), while the cattle excreta - derived pyrolytic product was composed of a variety of chemical groups such as oxygenates, polycyclic aromatic compounds, N -, S -, and B - containing compounds, and halogenated compounds. Pyrolysis temperature had no significant effect on the selectivity toward each chemical groups found in the condensables derived from either the mulching film waste or cattle excreta. The addition of the cattle excreta to the pyrolysis of the mulching film waste increased the yield of non - condensables and enhanced selectivity toward H2 between 500 °C and 900 °C, compared to the pyrolysis of the mulching film waste only.

One of the sustainable and effective ways to improve the thermal properties', 'thermal properties', 'thermal properties of these cementitious composites. One of the sustainable and effective ways to improve the thermal properties of cementitious composites is with the incorporation of various waste. Therefore, this paper aims to discuss different types of wastes that can be recycled into cementitious composites to improve the thermal properties ( i. e. reduce thermal conductivity ) based on existing experimental studies. Discussion from this paper showed that recycled materials such as rubber and plastics can be used to reduce the thermal conductivity of cementitious composites when used as a replacement of up to 50 % of natural aggregates. It was also concluded that there is a good relationship between density and thermal conductivity of cementitious composites and waste / recycled materials can be incorporated as aggregate / filler in cementitious composites to improve the thermal performance', 'thermal']\n",

Results indicate that workability increased with increasing percentages of waste PET plastics until the 40 % PET level, beyond which workability reduces. Compressive and split tensile strength decreased with increasing percentages of waste PET plastics. However, 10 % to 40 % - PET - modified mixes achieved the recommended strength for M20 concrete. Microstructural analysis on the 30 % PET indicates higher quantities of O and Ca, and trivial percentages of Mg, Si, C, Al, and Au. Whereas 100 % PET indicates the presence of only C, O, and Au. 100 % PET endures three transition stages during heat flow. A glass transition, an exothermic peak below decomposition temperature during cooling at a temperature of 199. 88 °C from PET crystallization, and a baseline shift after the endothermic peak at 243. 22°C. Thermogravimetry revealed that 100 % PET suffers a dual - stage decomposition, an initial stage accounting for an 87. 41 % reduction in sample mass and a second stage accounting for a further mass loss of 12. 79 %. Highly significant statistical correlations and regressions developed variations between PET % and the workability and mechanical parameters.

Whereas 100 % PET indicates the presence of only C, O, and Au. 100 % PET endures three transition stages during heat flow. A glass transition, an exothermic peak below decomposition temperature during cooling at a temperature of 199. 88 °C from PET crystallization, and a baseline shift after the endothermic peak at 243. 22°C. Thermogravimetry revealed that 100 % PET suffers a dual - stage decomposition, an initial stage accounting for an 87. 41 % reduction in sample mass and a second stage accounting for a further mass loss of 12. 79 %. Highly significant statistical correlations and regressions developed variations between PET % and the workability and mechanical parameters. The study shows that heat - processed PET - modified concrete is appropriate for structural applications due to its suitable fresh, mechanical, microstructural, and thermal properties']\n",

Herein, we report a facile solvothermal method of waste poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) bottles for the massive production of Co - MOF nanorod and construct a dual - functional Co - MOF / carbon nanotube ( CNT ) solar evaporator integrated with advanced oxidation process for simultaneous wastewater purification and freshwater production. Firstly, we prove that the evaporator owns high sunlight absorption due to the presence of CNT, super - hydrophilicity, and low heat conductivity, which endow it with fine photothermal conversion capability and reduced vaporization enthalpy. Benefiting from the above advantages, Co - MOF / CNT evaporator displays a high evaporation rate of 2. 25 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2 illumination, when treating tetracycline ( TC ) - polluted water, along with good mechanical property, high flexibility, long - term stability, and high scalability. Secondly, based on the results of COMSOL and density functional theory calculation, the localized solar heat from CNT and rich open cobalt sites of Co - MOF nanorod are proved to play a synergistic effect in the activation of peroxymonosulfate to generate various oxidation reactive species. Thereby, the dual - functional evaporator achieves a superb TC degradation\n",

Firstly, we prove that the evaporator owns high sunlight absorption due to the presence of CNT, super - hydrophilicity, and low heat conductivity, which endow it with fine photothermal conversion capability and reduced vaporization enthalpy. Benefiting from the above advantages, Co - MOF / CNT evaporator displays a high evaporation rate of 2. 25 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2 illumination, when treating tetracycline ( TC ) - polluted water, along with good mechanical property, high flexibility, long - term stability, and high scalability. Secondly, based on the results of COMSOL and density functional theory calculation, the localized solar heat from CNT and rich open cobalt sites of Co - MOF nanorod are proved to play a synergistic effect in the activation of peroxymonosulfate to generate various oxidation reactive species. Thereby, the dual - functional evaporator achieves a superb TC degradation activity. Lastly, an outdoor device is designed for freshwater generation and catalytic decomposition of TC.

       "{'context': 'In this work, a hibonite-type Ni/La-hexaaluminate (Ni/LHA) synthesized from an industrial waste is used and compared as catalyst in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 973 K. The structure, catalytic behavior, and stability during a run time of at least 50 h of three Ni-catalysts obtained from two commercial supports and two preparation methods were used for comparison. An aluminum solution (9.40 g/L) obtained from an aluminum saline slag waste by acid extraction was used to synthesize the hexaaluminate by mixing with a stoichiometric amount of lanthanum nitrate and methanol/Peg400/PegMn400 under hydrothermal conditions at 493 K for 16 h. The Ni/LHA catalyst (10 wt% NiO) was obtained by impregnation of the synthesized support, calcined previously at 1473 K for 2 h. The resulting solids were characterized by several techniques as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption at 77 K, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). In order to compare the catalytic behavior and properties of the Ni/LHA catalyst, three Ni catalysts obtained from two commercial supports (γ-Al2O3 and SiO2) and two preparation methods (wet impregnation (I) and precipitation-deposition (PD)) were synthesized. Analysis of the TPR patterns for the catalysts allowed the type of metal support interaction and NiO species to be determined, with a weak interaction with the support being observed in Ni/LHA and Ni–I/SiO2. The NiO species observed, with crystallite sizes between 9.7 and 40.4 nm, confirm the X-ray structural analyses. The Ni/LHA catalyst was found to be active and very stable in the DRM reaction after 50 h. The catalytic behavior was evaluated from the CO2 and CH4 conversions, as well as the H2/CO selectivity, with values of 99% over almost all the time range evaluated. The behavior of this catalyst is comparable to that of Ni–I/Al2O3 and Ni-PD/SiO2. The results found indicating that the strong interaction of nickel with the support favors the stability of the catalysts in the DRM reaction.',\n",
