The structural and morphological characterization indicate that the CuST nanoparticles have an average size of size of 41 \u00b1 2 nm and present a mixture of anatase/brookite phases. The CuS/TiO2 powders were dispersed in water contaminated with 4-CP and produced a maximum degradation percentage of 92% after 4 h under UV\u2013VIS irradiation. In the case of the RBag-CuST and RPS-CuST composites, they floated on the contaminated water and produced maximum degradation percentages of 89 and 100%, respectively. After 3 cycles of continuous use, the degradation percentages decreased from 92 to 84%, from 89 to 81% and from 100 to 95% for the CuS/TiO2 powders, RPS-CuST and RBag-CuST composites, respectively. Scavenger experiments were carried out and found that the main oxidizing agent for the degradation of 4-CP was the OH radical. The production of such radical decreased in the order RBag-CuST > CuS/TiO2-powders > RPS-CuST. The RBag-CuST was more efficient for the degradation of 4-CP because its production of oxidizing agents was the highest and it contained more oxygen vacancies defects (electron trapping centers) than the other photocatalysts, which was confirmed by the absorbance measurements.

The CO2 agent reduced the yields of condensables (e.g., benzoic acids, phthalic acids, esters, biphenyls, fluorenes) and decomposition residue (e.g., char and wax), which could be attributed to the enhancement of the thermal cracking of volatiles evolved during the banner waste conversion by CO2 and the C\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds present in the feedstock.

Among the wastes, spent petroleum catalysts, medical waste, electronic scraps, battery wastes, metal finishing industry waste, and fly ash are some of the largest industrially-generated wastes. Various metal recovery processes involve physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics of waste streams and target metals for separation and extraction. The current challenges of pyrometallurgy, modification on the hydrometallurgy, physical and chemical methods and other advanced technologies are presented in this review. The hydrometallurgical method, which involves dissolving and leaching, is a proven and successful process for recovering metals from various raw materials. Several other recovery methods have been proposed and are currently being implemented; the problem is that most of them are only successful in retrieving certain metals based on specific properties of industrial waste. The recovered metal solutions are further concentrated and purified using adsorption, cementation, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration and ion flotation techniques, which can also be applied to other liquid waste streams. The recovery method only makes sense if the recovery cost is much less than the value of the precious metal. The limitations placed on waste disposal and stringent environmental legislation require environmental-friendly metal recovery technologies. This review paper provides critical information that enables researchers to identify a proper method for metal recovery from different industrial wastes, and also it benefits researchers and stakeholders in determining research directions and making waste management-related decisions.", "qas": [{"id": "19", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "Cr", "answer_start": 545}, {"text": "Ni", "answer_start": 521}, {"text": "Au", "answer_start": 513}, {"text": "Mo", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "Co", "answer_start": 529}, {"text": "Cu", "answer_start": 533}, {"text": "Zn", "answer_start": 537}, {"text": "Ag", "answer_start": 517}]}]}, {"context": "In this work, hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolites, with the high Si/TPA+ ratio of 34 and Si/Al ratios of 100 and 30, have been synthesized by the mesoporogen-free, Na+-free, and steam-assisted crystallization route using industrial silica sol as the silicon source.

Catalytic cracking is performed using two different catalysts; HZSM-5 and 5%Fe/HZSM-5 in which later results in higher liquid yield (76 wt%) than former (60 wt%) having comparable fuel characteristics. GC\u2013MS results confirm that liquid product obtained via catalytic cracking contains higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons (C6-C20); 66.39% for 5%Fe/HZSM-5 and 47.33% for HZSM-5 which is comparatively higher than that obtained in thermal cracking (27.39%). FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies confirm that liquid hydrocarbons obtained via catalytic cracking have comparable chemical characteristics with fuel range hydrocarbons.

To tackle the challenge of recovering non-recyclable plastics via pyrolysis, it is necessary to determine their actual composition. Visual separation of collected non-recyclable plastics was performed, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the accuracy of visual separation. A significant amount of plastics labelled as \u201cother\u201d was found. Since the composition of \u201cother\u201d waste plastics has not been sufficiently investigated, relatively few studies on their pyrolysis have been conducted. Therefore, they were characterised and added to the mixture with other found polymer types of non-recyclable plastics. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to determine thermochemical behaviour and kinetic parameters required for laboratory pyrolysis investigation. Kinetic analysis was conducted using the Friedman isoconversional model-free method and non-linear multivariate regression method. The goal of this paper was to analyse the kinetics, determine the product yield and characteristics of the pyrolysis process of non-recyclable plastics over zeolite catalysts. It was found how the decomposition of non-recyclable plastics occurs in two decomposition steps. The activation energy of non-recyclable plastics was 144 kJ/mol in the first stage of decomposition and 262 kJ/mol in the second stage of decomposition. It decreased by 34% and 6.5% after fresh fluid catalytic cracking catalyst was added and 41% and 18.3% with iron-modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalyst. The yield of condensate was 55% (wax) for the original sample, and it decreased to 50% (wax and oil) and 27% (mostly oil) with fresh fluid catalytic cracking and iron modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts. Processes with catalysts promoted the formation of olefins and aromatic compounds in pyrolytic oil.

The results revealed that compared to the non-catalytic conversion of banner waste under N2 environment, the conversion under CO2 yielded more non-condensable gases owing to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles. In addition, the CO and CH4 yields at >700 \u00b0C in CO2 increased considerably owing to the reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction and CO2 methanation. The CO2 agent reduced the yields of condensables (e.g., benzoic acids, phthalic acids, esters, biphenyls, fluorenes) and decomposition residue (e.g., char and wax), which could be attributed to the enhancement of the thermal cracking of volatiles evolved during the banner waste conversion by CO2 and the C\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds present in the feedstock. In addition, the Co3O4 catalyst promoted the decarboxylation reaction under N2 environment, whereas it promoted the methanation and reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction under CO2. This indicates that compared to the non-catalytic CO2-assisted banner waste conversion, the use of CO2 for the conversion of banner waste in the presence of Co3O4 significantly increased the yields of CH4 and CO. Furthermore, Co3O4 promoted the thermal cracking of polyester bond, thus decreasing the yields of long-chain chemical compounds. In addition, the simultaneous use of Co3O4 catalyst and CO2 agent minimized the formation of char and wax.

Lignocellulosic biomass, which is the most abundant and sustainable biomass on earth, is a potential renewable resource for the production of a wide range of products (e.g., chemicals, fuels, materials) that could be used to replace products currently produced by the petrochemical industry. Large amounts of lignocellulosic materials are generated as waste by-products of various industrial and agro-based processes. Efficient valorization of such materials would lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and waste volumes and would bring considerable economic benefits.               Various approaches are available for the conversion of lignocellulosic materials into high-value products. In this work, partial wet oxidation (WO) by molecular oxygen is proposed as a potential industrial process for the production of chemicals, particularly low-molecular carboxylic acids, from lignocellulosic biomass waste. The study investigated the catalytic potential of two homogenous heteropoly acid catalysts for the partial WO of lignin based on their effectiveness as regards carboxylic acid yield and lignin conversion. Recovery of the carboxylic acids produced was studied using solvent extraction. Additionally, an enzyme-mediated approach for coproduction of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and fermentable sugars is proposed. In this work, alkaline lignin and cellulose (wood pulp and filter paper) were used as a model of lignocellulosic feed materials for the partial WO and enzymatic hydrolysis experiments, respectively.               Formic acid, acetic acid, and succinic acids are among the major products produced by the partial WO of lignin in alkaline and neutral aqueous solutions. In this work, optimum reaction conditions to obtain the maximum yield of products were investigated. An important finding is that in an alkaline medium, the overall yield of products from partial WO decreased at higher lignin concentration. It was found that this reduction could be attributed to repolymerization/condensation side reactions of lignin fragments that compete with oxidative lignin depolymerization reactions.               Of the two catalysts studied, the phosphomolybdate catalyst (H3PMo12O4) provided the best results in terms of both the lignin conversion rate and the total yield of carboxylic acids. Although both heteropolyacids showed different catalytic behaviors, the reaction pathway of the lignin oxidation seems to be determined by the type of addenda atom in the HPA catalyst, with Mo favoring a selective oxidation reaction. In addition, it was found that recovery of the two catalysts could be easily achieved, which would make partial lignin WO an environmentally friendly and potentially economically viable process.               In the solvent extraction studies, various types of extractants were evaluated. Different factors were considered in the solvent selection process. Of the tested solvents, Alamine 336 and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) solvents showed the most promising results and both solvents can be used to recover the studied components from aqueous solutions.

Another important finding was that significant recovery of fermentable sugars (20\u201360wt.%), which would otherwise have entered the acid waste stream, is achievable with this method.

This paper provides a review of the broad range of eggshell waste use in polymer, metal and ceramic composites, and in other applications such as adsorbents, catalysts, additives and functional materials. The different types and sources of CaCO3 are presented. An overview is given about the eggshell treatment methods and parameters, which fall broadly in two categories, low temperature treatment of CaCO3 particles, and high temperature treatment involving carbonization or calcination. The mechanical properties of structural composites with eggshell derived particles are discussed for polymer, metal and ceramic matrix materials.

Catalytic cracking is performed using two different catalysts; HZSM-5 and 5%Fe/HZSM-5 in which later results in higher liquid yield (76 wt%) than former (60 wt%) having comparable fuel characteristics. GC\u2013MS results confirm that liquid product obtained via catalytic cracking contains higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons (C6-C20); 66.39% for 5%Fe/HZSM-5 and 47.33% for HZSM-5 which is comparatively higher than that obtained in thermal cracking (27.39%).

These properties make its disposal problematic, as items made from PVC retain their form for decades. The objective of this study is to provide an effective waste management method for the degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high-value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron(III) chloride. The iron(III)-tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono- and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton-type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites (sulfonated groups) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon-to-sulphur atom (C/S) ratio can vary from 8:1 to 29:1. The degradation efficiency, which is typically defined in terms of the bulk mass of the treated PVC plastics, was found to be greater than 98% in all cases.

Furthermore, traditional plastic-to-fuels technology looks like another expensive way to burn fossil fuels, making no contribution to the plastic circular economy. By learning from the developed plastic-to-fuels technology, achieving the conversion of plastic waste into naphtha or plastic monomers that can be used for new plastic manufacturing in a closed-loop way is a more promising resource recovery pathway.

The bulk of the liquid products produced were lighter fractions with a peak around the gasoline range.", "qas": [{"id": "1136", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "HY-zeolite", "answer_start": 74}]}]}, {"context": "New recyclable imidazolium-tagged ruthenium catalysts have been developed to perform olefin metathesis in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). High level of recyclability combined with a high reactivity were obtained in the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of a variety of di- or tri-substituted and/or oxygen-containing dienes. Extremely low residual ruthenium levels were detected in the RCM products (average of 7.3ppm per run). Several examples of olefin cross-metathesis (CM) have been also studied.", "qas": [{"id": "1137", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "ruthenium", "answer_start": 34}]}]}, {"context": "A series of nanocomposite photocatalysts was prepared from aqueous dispersions of Degussa P25 TiO2 and exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) by heterocoagulation. The structure and catalytic activity of samples in the photooxidation of phenol were characterized in line with their separability by controlled settling experiments at different pHs, irradiation times and mechanical exposure. It was found that single or few-layer graphene oxide sheets were dispersed uniformly in the matrix of titanium dioxide aggregates and were partially reduced to oxygen-containing graphene-like carbon. Although the presence of GO was associated with a loss of photocatalytic efficiency, it has induced an accelerated sedimentation of catalyst slurry as compared to pure TiO2, resulting in the complete separation of photocatalyst from the treated water in a highly reduced time scale. The loose physical network of weakly adhered particles can be destroyed by sonication or other strong mechanical impacts, but spontaneous aggregation occurs upon mild redispersion. Therefore, heterocoagulation is reversibly induced and can be used to collect the finely suspended catalyst particles worn off from the composite. Extensive reuse of the catalyst without its abrasion and the concomitant need of its post-treatment separation is thus possible. Along with the beneficial sedimentation properties of the composites, this facilitates their use for large scale treatment of waste waters.", "qas": [{"id": "1138", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "graphene", "answer_start": 421}, {"text": "graphene-like", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "TiO2", "answer_start": 94}]}]}]
