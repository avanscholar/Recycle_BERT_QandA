       "[{'context': '               Pyrolysis is a suitable process for recycling polymer composites because the thermal decomposition products of the polymer matrix evaporate, and thus the reinforcement materials can be recovered and reused. The products of pyrolysis carried out at an appropriate temperature are monomers and other valuable chemicals. This chapter describes the pyrolysis reactions and products of frequently used thermoplastics and thermosets in polymer composites. Published results on pyrolysis of various polymer composites are discussed in order to understand the requirements of successful plastic composite recycling by pyrolysis. The environmental concern related to pyrolysis of flame retardants containing polymer composites is also touched upon and some methods are referred to for decreasing or eliminating toxic and harmful compounds from the pyrolysis products of halogenated flame retardants.

Its degradation products pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health. Polyolefins can be converted to clean oils or fuels by using the supercritical water liquefaction (SWL) method at high pressures (≥23 MPa), which require high capital and energy costs. A new low-pressure (~2 MPa) hydrothermal processing (LP-HTP) method is developed to convert polyolefin waste with 50% or more polypropylene into oils with 87% yield at 450 °C and 45 min. The oils, which are C4 to C25 hydrocarbons, can be distilled into clean gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel. With this method, up to 190 million tons of fuels can be produced annually from polyolefin waste, resulting in savings of 92% of the energy and 71% of the GHG emissions compared to conventional methods for producing fuels.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This review critically evaluates the plastic accumulation challenges and their environmental (primarily) and human (secondarily) impacts. It also emphasizes on their degradation and fragmentation phenomena under marine conditions. In addition, it takes into account the leachability of the various chemical substances (additives) embedded in plastic products to improve their polymeric properties and extend their life. Regardless of their effectiveness in enhancing the polymeric function of plastic products, these additives can potentially contaminate air, soil, food, and water. Several findings have shown that, regardless of their types and sizes, plastics can be degraded and/or fragmented under marine conditions. Therefore, the estimation of fragmentation and degradation rates via a reliable developed model is required to better understand the marine environmental status. The main parameter, which is responsible for initiating the fragmentation of plastics, is sunlight/UV radiation. Yet, UV- radiation alone is not enough to fragment some plastic polymer types under marine conditions, additional factors are needed such as mechanical abrasion. It should be also mentioned that most current studies on plastic degradation and fragmentation centered on the primary stages of degradation. Thus, further studies are needed to better understand these phenomena and to identify their fate and environmental effects.',\n",

Compared with non-modified mixture, the unaged plastic-modified mixture presented fair moisture susceptibility, acceptable workability, better resistance to traffic-compaction, higher stiffness, higher rutting resistance and slightly lower fatigue resistance. After ageing, the modified mixture performed better in all these aspects. Therefore, incorporating LDPE waste into AC is feasible with environmental and technical benefits.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The combination of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porosity and catalytic activity with plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs) defines a new paradigm in photocatalytic degradation of ecotoxicants. Herein, we designed a novel composite derived from a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste, MOF – UiO-66, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to degrade paraoxon as a nerve agent simulant under plasmon excitation. The prepared material was characterized by spectroscopic: XRD, UV–Vis, FT-IR, XPS, microscopic: SEM (EDX), TEM and ICP-MS, TGA, BET analysis, and NH3 TPD techniques. We found the balance between pore availability of UiO-66 for paraoxon adsorption, plasmonic enhancement, and the cost of the final composite. In the case of PET@UiO-66-Ag25, paraoxon is degraded for 1 h with ∼ 95 % efficiency under 455 nm. The synergetic degradation mechanism of UiO-66 and AgNPs was proved by experiments with different wavelengths of illumination, PET@Ag, and control reaction of Fisher esterification. The synergetic effect is explained by weakening the chemical bonds in the transition state between the Zr site (Lewis’s acid centers) and paraoxon via plasmon excitation and energy transfer. Moreover, PET@UiO-66-Ag25 is overperforming other materials in terms of environmental impact, easiness of preparation, visible light usage, high apparent quantum yield, and recycling performance.',\n",

The effect of digestion temperatures (110oC–170 °C) on the weight reduction from the SOW and the availability of the nutrients were thoroughly investigated. The potential weight reduction of 75.2% was achieved at a temperature of 150 °C for 135 min, as illustrated by response surface methodology (RSM). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) study was carried out to analyze the changes into surface morphology of the sample before and after the digestion. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was conducted to study the mineralization process. Thermogravimetric-Differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was conducted to study the thermal decomposition behavior of the untreated and digested SOW. The digested SOW resulted high nutrient-rich end product (N-2.08 ± 0.01%, P-0.42 ± 0.00%, & K-1.65 ± 0.06%), which have potential to be used as organic fertilizer. Fertilizing potential of the digested SOW complied with the delineated norms of the organic fertilizer given by the Fertilizer Association of India (2019). Maturity and phytotoxicity of the digested SOW were explored on the basis of C:N ratio (18.07 ± 0.17), humification index (3.43 ± 0.02), heavy metals content, as well as through seed germination index (>90%).

These composites were made of recycled bags (RBag) or recycled polystyrene (RPS) from food packaging and CuS/TiO2 (CuST) nanoparticles. The structural and morphological characterization indicate that the CuST nanoparticles have an average size of size of 41 ± 2 nm and present a mixture of anatase/brookite phases. The CuS/TiO2 powders were dispersed in water contaminated with 4-CP and produced a maximum degradation percentage of 92% after 4 h under UV–VIS irradiation. In the case of the RBag-CuST and RPS-CuST composites, they floated on the contaminated water and produced maximum degradation percentages of 89 and 100%, respectively. After 3 cycles of continuous use, the degradation percentages decreased from 92 to 84%, from 89 to 81% and from 100 to 95% for the CuS/TiO2 powders, RPS-CuST and RBag-CuST composites, respectively. Scavenger experiments were carried out and found that the main oxidizing agent for the degradation of 4-CP was the OH radical. The production of such radical decreased in the order RBag-CuST > CuS/TiO2-powders > RPS-CuST. The RBag-CuST was more efficient for the degradation of 4-CP because its production of oxidizing agents was the highest and it contained more oxygen vacancies defects (electron trapping centers) than the other photocatalysts, which was confirmed by the absorbance measurements. In general, we demonstrated that making flexible photocatalytic materials from recycled bags/polystyrene is a feasible and low cost option to remove pesticide contaminants from the drinking water.

       " {'context': 'Environmental contamination due to plastic waste mismanagement is a growing global concern. Plastic problem is of particular concern to the Indian Ocean nations as Asia currently contributes to the highest share of mismanaged plastic waste. Consequently, there is a worldwide interest to understand the distribution and transboundary movement of plastic from this region, which is crucial for implementing management measures. This review article focuses on current knowledge of plastic research, policies, waste management, socio-economics, challenges, and research opportunities. To date, marine plastic studies have focused on a few locations, providing an analysis of distribution and plastic–organism interactions in the Indian marine system. Along with scientific investigation, enforcement, improvisation, and, if necessary, framing new policies, integrated technologies to manage plastic waste, and behavioural changes are essential to mitigate plastic pollution. Such measures will be effective through a combination of actions among national and international researchers, industries, environmental managers, and the public.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were measured in 470 waste plastic articles from Ireland between 2019 and 2020. We identified articles containing concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A) exceeding European Union limits. Enforcement of existing limits of 1000 mg/kg will render an estimated 3.1% (2800 t) of articles in the waste categories studied unrecyclable, increasing to: 4.0, 4.9, and 5.6% if limits were reduced to 500, 200, and 100 mg/kg respectively. Meanwhile, enforcing limits of 1,000, 500, 200, and 100 mg/kg will respectively remove 78, 82, 84, and 85% of PBDEs, HBCDD, and TBBP-A present in such waste. Other FRs targeted were detected infrequently and predominantly at very low concentrations. However, 2,4,6-tris(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (TTBP-TAZ) was detected in 3 display/IT product samples at 14,000 to 32,000 mg/kg, indicating elevated concentrations of FRs used as alternatives to PBDEs and HBCDD, will likely increase in future. Comparison with data for Ireland in 2015–16, revealed concentrations and exceedances of limits for PBDEs, HBCDD, and TBBP-A were similar or have declined. For end-of-life vehicle fabrics and foams, HBCDD and ΣPBDE concentrations declined significantly (p < 0.05) since 2015–16. Moreover, ΣPBDE concentrations in waste small domestic appliances are significantly lower in 2019–20, with a similarly significant decline for TBBP-A in waste IT and telecommunications articles. In contrast, HBCDD concentrations in waste extruded polystyrene increased significantly between 2015–16 and 2019–20. For other waste categories studied, no statistically significant temporal trends are evident (p > 0.05). Fewer samples exceeded PBDE and HBCDD limits in 2019–20 (7.8%) than 2015–16 (8.7%), while exceedances for TBBP-A fell from 2.4% in 2015–16 to 0.57% in 2019–20. While comparison between the 2015–16 and 2019-20 datasets provide a preliminary indication of changes, further monitoring is required if the impact of legislation designed to eliminate HFRs from the waste stream is to be fully evaluated.',\n",

To prevent the spread of these rays, either thick concrete walls should be used or composite walls including iron sheets and concrete should be used to reduce the thickness of the walls. To solve this problem, colemanite is a good option with a high percentage of boron, which is a very good absorber of harmful radioactive rays. In this regard, new research has been started to use this material as an aggregate and filler in concrete, which has yielded good results. This chapter introduces boron and in particular introduces colemanite, which is used in the radiation protection industry. The current trend is the use of boron-based compounds, abundant materials with relatively affordable costs and with which developers have extensive experience. More efficient boron-based compounds are still being developed today. An optimal solution for the development of new neutron shields is the use of boron-based materials that incorporate rare earth, allowing a compromise to develop optimal neutron absorption solutions for different energy spectra.

       " {'context': 'A new treatment process for waste plastics is proposed, in which mixtures of waste plastics and solid carbon material are heated under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures. Two variables—temperature and plastics addition ratio—were considered during the heat treatment and crushing tests. A series of tests was performed to explore the corresponding mechanism. The optimum heat treatment temperature was 723 K, and the optimum plastic addition ratio was 20%. Additionally, non-isothermal CO2 gasification tests of ground products conducted using a thermogravimetric analyser revealed that the gasification reactivity of products with plastic addition was better than that of the coal powder. The reactivity of the samples was in the following order: 20% > 25% > 15% > 10% > semi-coke. Three representative kinetics models, random pore model (RPM), volume reaction model (VM), and unreacted core model (URCM), were employed to analyse the kinetics of gasification. The RPM and VM were found to be suitable for the gasification of the products, which were characterised by various methods, and the heat treatment mechanism was analysed and discussed from the physical and chemical aspects. The findings herein are expected to be useful for the treatment of waste plastics.',\n",

Developing repairable, malleable and recyclable thermoset is necessary to reduce the ever-increasing polymer waste as well as to extent the service life of the existing polymer materials. As a new class of “recyclable” and/or “reprocessable” crosslinked polymer, “vitrimers” have just emerged in the recent decade. Vitrimers are permanently crosslinked polymers based on dynamic covalent networks. Such networks are stable at the service temperature yet become labile and reprocessable at elevated temperatures due to stimulus activated bond-exchange reactions. Because vitrimers combine the advantages of both thermosets and thermoplastics, they have received extensive attention. There are many vitrimer chemistries that have been reported. In this review, the discussion is focused on the developments of vitrimers based on dynamic transesterification reaction (DTER) between hydroxy groups and ester bonds, which is one of the most representative vitrimer chemistries. This review mainly includes the discussions of synthetic methods, vitrimer behaviors, application developments, and recycling methods. In addition, the challenges and outlook are also provided.',\n",

Firstly, the degradation mechanisms of eight kinds of plastics, two polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene), two polyamide resins (nylon-6 and nylon-6,6), polystyrene and three polyesters (polycarbonate, poly(butylene terephthalate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate), were investigated both in nitrogen and steam as the carrier gas. Plastics except for polyesters were degraded without any influences of the kinds of the carrier gas, leaving negligibly small amount of carbonaceous residue. Polyesters, which were degraded with producing large amount of the residue in nitrogen, were succeeded to be hydrolyzed at high reaction rates in steam with producing hardly the carbonaceous residue. Secondly, a mixture of the waste plastics was continuously degraded to produce heavy oil in steam atmosphere by using a new reactor system. This system was composed of three kinds of reactors connected in series. One was a reactor filled with stirred heat medium particles, which enabled the high heat transfer rate, the high holdup and the good contact of the melted plastics with steam. The second was a tank reactor. The last one was a fixed bed reactor with FeOOH catalyst particles, which showed the catalysis in steam for the decomposition both of a wax and sublimate materials generated by the degradation of plastics. Furthermore, the oil produced from the proposed reactor system was continuously upgraded to produce gasoline and kerosene over Ni-REY catalyst in steam atmosphere.',\n",

The concentrations of a sum of 16 PAHs ranged from 44.8 to 3206μgkg−1 (dry weight basis), in the descending order of E-waste open burning sites (2065μgkg−1)>areas near burning sites (851μgkg−1)>rice fields (354μgkg−1)>reservoir areas (125μgkg−1). The dominant PAHs were naphthalene, phenanthrene and fluoranthene, which were mainly derived from incomplete combustion of E-waste (e.g. wire insulations and PVC materials), and partly from coal combustion and motorcycle exhausts. All individual and total PAH concentrations were significantly correlated with SOM except for naphthalene and acenaphthylene. Principal component analysis was performed, which indicated that PAHs were mainly distributed into three groups in accordance with their ring numbers and biological and anthropogenic source. In conclusion, PAH concentrations in the Guiyu soil were affected by the primitive E-waste recycling activities.',\n",

The extraction of NA generates high environmental impacts that negatively affect environmental preservation and conservation. Diverse alternative materials obtained in construction and demolition processes in civil construction worked have been studies as possible replacements for NA, with the purpose of reducing these environmental impacts. The foregoing study presents a state of knowledge review referring to the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) when these are used in the manufacturing of asphalt mixtures (mainly hot-mix asphalt HMA type). Environmental aspects are presented, as well as possible benefits and limitations of using RCA as replacements for NA in asphalt mixtures. However, it is not possible to establish a behavior pattern, since the characteristics of the RCA are very heterogeneous and vary from the original source of the concrete. It is highlighted from the literature that RCA has a wide potential for use in the manufacture of asphalt mixtures, since in most studies, the mixtures with these materials comply the quality requirements contemplated by the construction specifications, mainly in low-volume roads. Additionally, based on the literature review, some recommendations and suggestions are presented for future research.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In developing countries, recyclable material collectors cooperatives are presented as a public policy model for managing urban solid wastes with recyclable potential (MSWRP). They are a fundamental part of the resources recovery chain. Thus, this study proposes a method to help analyse the management performance of cooperatives in their operational activities in the recycling chain (OARC): in waste collection management, in production management, in waste marketing management, and as an instrument of social inclusion, income generation and MSWRP reduction. To exemplify the application of the method, longitudinal research was carried out on some characteristics of cooperatives based in a medium-sized city in Brazil. For data treatment, the DEA-SBM models, Tobit regression and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used. The results indicated that cooperatives are heterogeneous, with different levels of management performance and administrative organisation. This presents communication difficulties and creates disparities in the rent paid by the collection centres for the collection trucks. In some cases, cooperatives are organised with separate administrative sectors, while in others all administrative functions are performed by the president. The results also indicated the need for maintenance and an increase in public actions to integrate the cooperatives and waste collectors with the aim to guarantee greater control in the collection, production and commercialisation of MSWRP. This is important as improvements in cooperatives’ management performances in their OARC are fundamental to their survival and the improvement of their members’ quality of life.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study proposes a novel integrated material recovery and waste-to-hydrogen concept in view of enhancing resource efficiency and minimising environmental impact. A comprehensive techno-economic evaluation is conducted on an integrated system consisting of material recovery facility (MRF) and gasification of rejected materials for hydrogen production (Gasification-H2). Valorising these rejected materials through Gasification-H2 system can potentially offer a saving of 1.6 million £/y on disposal cost while diverting significant amount of waste from landfills. Owing to the high market value of hydrogen, the integrated system with material recovery and hydrogen production generates 4 times more revenues than a conventional MRF, though at the expense of higher capital and operating costs. The minimum hydrogen selling price lies in the range of 2.2 £/kg (100 dry t/h of rejects) and 6.1 £/kg (2 dry t/h of rejects). This study concludes that a larger Gasification-H2 system is desirable, i.e. greater than 100 dry t/h of rejects, to compete with the production cost of hydrogen generated from fossil-based systems. It is also recommended that an economically competitive production should comprise multiple MRF integrated with a large-scale Gasification-H2 system.',\n",

This process consists of three parts, removal of fluoride, collection of lanthanum, and transformation of lanthanum fluoride (LaF3). The E-pH diagram of the La-F-H2O system was constructed to learn about the composition variation of the system with pH. The removal efficiency of fluoride was 98.03%, and F− was reduced to 20 mg/L under the optimal conditions of the n(LaCl3):n(F−) of 1:1, the temperature of 80 °C, and the reaction time of 8 h. The residual lanthanum in the solution was collected as sodium lanthanum sulfate (NaLa(SO4)2) precipitate by sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and the collection efficiency of lanthanum was 98.05%. The defluoridation product LaF3 was transformed to lanthanum hydroxide (La(OH)3) by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and the transformation efficiency was 93.44%. The adsorption phenomenon of La(OH)3 to F− was found in the transformation process, which is not conducive to the recovery of La. The kinetics of the transformation process of LaF3 to La(OH)3 shows that the rate-controlling step is the diffusion of the solid product layer, and the average apparent activation energy is 37.99 kJ/mol at 25–100 °C.',\n",

The resulting process for liquefaction of plastic was termed as Poly-Urja process and produced hydrocarbon oil was termed as HC-Oil. The CTL explores copper doped TiO2 (Cu@TiO2) catalyst as a selective, robust, non-toxic, inexpensive and promising material for liquefaction of polyolefinic plastic waste with minimum char and gas formation. The use of simple, non-expensive and non-complex co-precipitation method has provided a series of Cu@TiO2 catalysts with variable composition of the metal. Of the synthesized catalysts, Cu@TiO2 with 5% metal loading gave maximum conversion and yield of HC-Oil in laboratory batch reactor. The physicochemical and surface morphological properties of the catalyst were studied by using ATR-FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, BET and ICP-MS. Process intensification study was conducted to obtain maximum conversion and yield. The intensified CTL process gave >85% conversion and >80% yield of HC-Oil at less stringent conditions. HC-Oil is a carbon rich substrate comprises of 75–85% carbon, 5–15% hydrogen, 5–10% other elements and have a calorific value of ~42 MJ/kg thus it can be used for multiple applications of energy, fuels and chemicals etc. Physicochemical characterization of HC-Oil showed the presence of long and short; straight and branched chains of hydrocarbons (C8-C28). Moreover, CTL can convert any combination of plastic waste into HC-Oil with minimum carbon loss and >80% yield. Thus, the CTL process for polyolefinic waste provides an efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to convert plastic waste into energy.',\n",

Therefore, this sector needs a great deal of intervention through policies that promote the energetic efficiency of the buildings. One of the most important structural components to reach this energetic efficiency is the facades. In this work, the facade ventilated is chosen due to its better thermal insulation behaviour. The environmental impact of the facade ventilated depends on the thermal insulation material. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the environmental impact of different ventilated facades according to their thermal insulation behavior. For this purpose, the life-cycle assessment is applied in ventilated facades with different materials in different locations. The materials studied are the rock wool, the natural cork and the recycled cork, and the locations considered are the different climatic areas of Spain. To reach a complete environmental assessment all the ventilated facades life-cycle is considered, from cradle to grave. To do this we use the Open LCA software with the Ecoinvent database with the ReCiPe method. The results show that the recycled cork is the thermal insulation with the lowest environmental impact regardless the location.',\n",

How to quickly and harmlessly dispose of the PVC-containing MSW and convert them into a valuable resource is an urgent issue at present. The application of catalysts has yet been proven to be effective in mitigating organic pollutant production. In the present study, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) were utilized to investigate the thermodynamic properties, kinetic parameters and pyrolysis characteristics of PVC with different zeolites including HZSM-5 with the Si/Al of 80 and 280, ferrierite, HY and MCM-41 zeolite. It turned out that the introduction of different catalysts with different pore structures and acid site concentrations made different catalytic effects on the cracking mechanism of PVC. Among the five zeolites, MCM-41 decreased temperature at the 50 % conversion to 296 °C, increased weight loss mate at a maximum of 25 %/min and generated fewer PAHs (whose changing amplitude decreased by 94 % in ex-situ catalytic mode in comparison to non-catalytic mode), indicative of its higher catalytic activity in PVC polymer degradation. Under the consideration of maximizing catalytic cracking activity and minimizing secondary pollutants production, non-catalytic dechlorination at approximately 300 °C followed by catalytic degradation in ex-situ mode over mesoporous MCM-41 at higher temperatures was the best recommendation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widespread tool used to guide decision-makers towards optimal strategic choices for sustainable growth. A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects. Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1:1 substitution ratio between similar materials/products, this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary. The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics. A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied, which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients (sometimes provided under different terminology). In this perspective, the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials, based on technical characteristics. These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies, one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste. In total, sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials, based on state of the art and presented case studies. The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies. The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients, useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities.',\n",

       " {'context': 'While the possibility of waste bottles’ PET conversion to fluorescent materials has been recently demonstrated, optimization of the conversion protocol based on rational material design may greatly enhance key characteristics of the upcycled material. In this study, conversion of PET to fluorescent nanomaterials by means of hydrothermal (HT) treatment of PET and products of PET pyrolysis, glycolysis, and aminolysis in the presence and in the absence of an oxidizing agent was systematically investigated to compare fluorescent properties of HT products. Among studied conversion routes, the direct HT conversion of PET or a combination of the HT treatment with the PET pre-treatment by either pyrolysis or glycolysis resulted in non-fluorescent of weakly fluorescent products, whereas aminolysis of PET bottle plastics followed by the HT treatment of the aminolysis products increased dramatically, up to tens to hundreds fold, the fluorescence of the products. Admixing of several percent of an oxidant, H2O2, to HT mixture further enhanced the product fluorescence yielding fluorescent nanoparticles (nitrogen-doped carbon dots, NCDs) with 25.3% conversion yield and the quantum yield of 9.1%. Based on 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy data, the mechanism of NCDs formation was proposed. The N-doped carbon dots obtained by waste PET upcycling were used for detection and quantification of Cu2+ ion at ppm and Fe3+ ion at ppb concentrations.',\n",

The addition of HDPE and PS increased total VFA yields by 28% and 47%, respectively, whereas the addition of PP and PET decreased total VFA yields by 6% and 2%, respectively. The highest enhancing performance of PS could be ascribed to its highly porous structure that could provide immobilization effects for microbial growth. Degradation of various plastics was confirmed by FESEM results, but the degrees were limited (i.e., 3.9–8.7%). Bacterial analysis showed that the addition of various plastics altered the community diversity. Phylum Thermotogae and genus Defluviitoga dominated all the reactors. Potential HDPE- and PS-degrading microbes could belong to genus Clostridium_sensu_stricto_8, while Tepidanaerobacter_syntrophicus could be PET-degrading microbes.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used plastics in the world. Accumulation of the discarded PET in the environment is creating a global environmental problem. Recently, a bacterial enzyme named PETase was found to have the novel ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the enzymatic activity of native PETase is still low limiting its possible use in recycling of PET. In this study, we developed a whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase on the surface of yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell to improve its degradation efficiency. Our data shows that PETase could be functionally displayed on the yeast cell with enhanced pH and thermal stability. The turnover rate of the PETase-displaying yeast whole-cell biocatalyst towards highly crystallized PET dramatically increased about 36-fold compared with that of purified PETase. Furthermore, the whole-cell biocatalyst showed stable turnover rate after seven repeated use and under some chemical/solvent conditions, and its ability to degrade different commercial highly crystallized PET bottles. Our results reveal that PETase-displaying whole-cell biocatalyst affords a promising route for efficient biological recycling of PET.',\n",

Though they have served as an excellent protection source in minimizing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading, they have still emerged as major environmental pollutants nowadays. These non-degradable COVID-19 plastic wastes (CPW) were treated through incineration and landfilling process, which may lead to either the release of harmful gases or contaminating the surrounding environment. Further, they can cause numerous health hazards to the human and animal populations. These plastic wastes can be efficiently managed through thermochemical processes like pyrolysis or gasification, which assist in degrading the plastic waste and also effectively convert them into useful energy-yielding products. The pyrolysis process promotes the formation of liquid fuels and chemicals, whereas gasification leads to syngas and hydrogen fuel production. These energy-yielding products can help to compensate for the fossil fuels depletion in the near future. There are many insights explained in terms of the types of reactors and influential factors that can be adopted for the pyrolysis and gasification process, to produce high efficient energy products from the wastes.

PBDEs in the soil sample collected from Tianjin University of Commerce in April 2019 increased significantly after 6 months of PMKF mulching owing to PMKFs as the main input source. The compositional profiles/congener patterns of the PBDEs in the soil and PMKFs became similar after 6 months. High correlations were found between ΣPBDEs in the soil and PMKFs in October 2019, with no significant correlation in April. Plants could take up, accumulate and biotransform PBDEs in contaminated soil. The uptake of BDE-209 by plants was the highest compared with other lesser brominated PBDE congeners, due to its higher log Kow value and molecular weight or size. BDE-47 taken up in the plant was biotransformed via hydroxylation. These results prove that the government's PMKF solution to haze is causing environmental problems in bare soil, i.e., PBDE pollution in both soil and nearby plants.

       " {'context': 'Functional polyethylene (PE) bearing pendant hydroxyl groups was dynamically crosslinked via reactive extrusion using commercially available N,N′-Bis[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ethylenediamine (TMSPEDA). This fast and efficient way allowed to produce PE vitrimers without synthetic effort or use of solvents, which makes the process environmentally friendly and easy to upscale. The dynamic crosslinking transformed thermoplastic PE into an elastic solid with greatly improved melt strength as revealed by DMTA and rheology. Mechanical properties could be tuned by varying the amount of TMSPEDA crosslinker. All prepared vitrimers were sparingly soluble in xylene and were not affected by moisture demonstrating crosslinked character, improved solvent resistance and excellent hydrolysis resistance which is of great importance for industrial applications. Despite the crosslink nature of the material, the dynamic silyl ether exchange enabled processability and recyclability of this system using industrially relevant techniques like injection and compression molding.',\n",

The campus has a per capita solid waste generation rate of about 0.06kg/day. About 96.58% of the total waste is recyclable, and has about 51.85% biomass potential. Analysis of variance showed that differently dominated areas of the campus have different quantities and compositions of wastes mainly due to significant variation of organic and polythene components across the differently dominated areas. The barriers against effective solid waste management and recommendations for integrated solid waste management strategies were made to include solid waste generation reduction, re-usage, recycling, composting, and proper training and provision of incentive and other fiscal policies.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Infrared-fast pyrolysis (IF) has proven effective for examining the co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene (PE) and corn stover (CS) by optimizing secondary reactions. In this study, a fixed-bed reactor with fast infrared heating was adopted to explore the distribution of pyrolysis products and compare the product compositions generated by IF with those produced by electric-conventional slow pyrolysis (ECS). Increasing the PE ratio first increased the oil yield and then reduced it at 600 °C during the co-pyrolysis process by IF. The maximum oil yield produced by IF in PE50%-CS50% was 1.6 times the calculated yield, whereas the oil generated by ECS were roughly comparable to the calculated amount. Owing to the sluggish heating rate in ECS, the pyrolysis volatiles experienced a prolonged residence time in the high-temperature area, resulting in a severe secondary reaction and large variations in H2 and CO2 content. The highest H2 content in PE75%-CS25% was 18.09 vol%, which was 3.4 times the calculated value. The lowest CO2 content was 45.7 vol% in PE50%-CS50%, which was 27% less than predicted. During IF, The phenols, ketones, acids, aldehydes, and polyaromatic rings gradually decreased as the PE ratio increased, while the alcohol and ester content initially increased and then decreased. The alcohol reached a maximum content of 57.3% in CS50%-PE50%, while the ester reached a maximum value in PE25%-CS75%. The increased PE content produced a large number of hydrogen radicals that accelerated the hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of phenols and furans.',\n",

How to quickly and harmlessly dispose of the PVC-containing MSW and convert them into a valuable resource is an urgent issue at present. The application of catalysts has yet been proven to be effective in mitigating organic pollutant production. In the present study, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) were utilized to investigate the thermodynamic properties, kinetic parameters and pyrolysis characteristics of PVC with different zeolites including HZSM-5 with the Si/Al of 80 and 280, ferrierite, HY and MCM-41 zeolite. It turned out that the introduction of different catalysts with different pore structures and acid site concentrations made different catalytic effects on the cracking mechanism of PVC. Among the five zeolites, MCM-41 decreased temperature at the 50 % conversion to 296 °C, increased weight loss mate at a maximum of 25 %/min and generated fewer PAHs (whose changing amplitude decreased by 94 % in ex-situ catalytic mode in comparison to non-catalytic mode), indicative of its higher catalytic activity in PVC polymer degradation. Under the consideration of maximizing catalytic cracking activity and minimizing secondary pollutants production, non-catalytic dechlorination at approximately 300 °C followed by catalytic degradation in ex-situ mode over mesoporous MCM-41 at higher temperatures was the best recommendation.',\n",

The resulting process for liquefaction of plastic was termed as Poly-Urja process and produced hydrocarbon oil was termed as HC-Oil. The CTL explores copper doped TiO2 (Cu@TiO2) catalyst as a selective, robust, non-toxic, inexpensive and promising material for liquefaction of polyolefinic plastic waste with minimum char and gas formation. The use of simple, non-expensive and non-complex co-precipitation method has provided a series of Cu@TiO2 catalysts with variable composition of the metal. Of the synthesized catalysts, Cu@TiO2 with 5% metal loading gave maximum conversion and yield of HC-Oil in laboratory batch reactor. The physicochemical and surface morphological properties of the catalyst were studied by using ATR-FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, BET and ICP-MS. Process intensification study was conducted to obtain maximum conversion and yield. The intensified CTL process gave >85% conversion and >80% yield of HC-Oil at less stringent conditions. HC-Oil is a carbon rich substrate comprises of 75–85% carbon, 5–15% hydrogen, 5–10% other elements and have a calorific value of ~42 MJ/kg thus it can be used for multiple applications of energy, fuels and chemicals etc. Physicochemical characterization of HC-Oil showed the presence of long and short; straight and branched chains of hydrocarbons (C8-C28). Moreover, CTL can convert any combination of plastic waste into HC-Oil with minimum carbon loss and >80% yield. Thus, the CTL process for polyolefinic waste provides an efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to convert plastic waste into energy.',\n",

The Fraser-Suzuki deconvolution function was adopted to fit the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves into three pseudo-reactions. The apparent activation enegry (Ea), pre-exponential factor (A) and reaction mechanism models (f(a)) for each pseudo-reaction were identified. The results show that the use of CaO increased significantly the Ea value of the dehydrochlorination reaction but lowered that of the tar cracking reactions, indicating an apparent HCl release mitigation as well as tar compounds decomposition. The mechanism models of the three pseudo-reactions kept identical with or without CaO addition, which were A4 Avrami-Erofeev: ƒ(α)=4(1-α) [-ln(1-α)]3⁄4 for pseudo-reactions 1 and 3 and B1 Prout-Trompkins: ƒ(α)=α(1-α) for pseudo-reactions 2. The kinetic models of the pyrolysis of waste PVC and the mixtures were thus established. The obtained results could be used as a theoretical basis for the development and application of clean and efficient waste PVC plastics pyrolysis technology.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Zeolite exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins, but the reaction results are often controversial due to the differences in the lab-scale synthesized zeolites and the types of reactors selected. In this work, in order to eliminate the differences of catalysts synthesized by individual researchers, we studied the catalytic performance of four typical commercial zeolites (HZSM-5, Hβ, HY and SAPO-11) in the cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) by self-designed batch reactor. By comparing the reaction performance of four zeolites under the same condition and correlating with the pore structure and acidity of the zeolites, it was found that the acid strength of zeolites was positively correlated with the cracking conversion. HZSM-5 and Hβ zeolites with high acid strength achieved a LDPE conversion of above 94%. Large micropore is beneficial to the formation of isomerized products, but promotes the formation of coke precursors, resulting in serious coking. By analyzing the product distribution over different zeolites, it was observed that Hβ achieved the highest yield of gasoline components. HZSM-5 and HY exhibited high yields of aromatization products. The high aromatization activity of HZSM-5 was attributed to its strong acidity which enhanced the hydrogen transfer process, while HY possesses high concentrations of both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites, and the synergistic effect of these two acid sites promotes the aromatization process.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis has been identified as an ideal process to recycle mixed plastic waste (MPW). This study investigates the economics of a 40,000 t/y MPW pyrolysis process, called PlastPyro, located in Belgium, to an accuracy of ±15% i.e. “Definite Estimate”. The process uses molten metal in a direct heat treatment process to pyrolyse the waste. An internal rate of return (IRR) of 20% strongly indicates that a 40,000 t/y PlastPyro plant is financially attractive for private investors. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) is estimated to be €20.1 m or €26.1 m if the cost of capital is included. The operating expenditures (OPEX) of the plant are estimated €3.4 m per year. The sensitivity analysis shows six main variables having major impacts on the financial returns of a PlastPyro plant: (1) the addressable volume and quality of plastic waste, (2) the feedstock costs, (3) the capital and operating expenditures, (4) the revenues from the sale of the produced pyrolysis oil (P-oil), (5) the tipping fees and (6) the potential to co-locate a PlastPyro plant with a waste plastic sorting facility. For example, the 15-year low P-oil revenue price of €210/t results in an IRR of 20%; but on the 6th of March 2020 the P-oil price may have achieved €227/t, resulting in an IRR of 37%. The paper also shows that a reliable supply of MPW is available, and that reliable, accessible markets for the P-oil are available. Finally, cost estimates should state their accuracy and usually factorial cost estimates are not accurate enough to state the IRR.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this study, municipal polymer wastes that were no longer recyclable and were previously buried underground according to the usual municipal waste management program were converted to liquid fuel by catalytic pyrolysis technique. In the first step, zeolite Y catalyst was used to improve the quality of liquid fuel. In the second step, MIL-53 (Cu) was incorporated onto zeolite and pyrolyzed in nitrogen in the atmosphere. The analysis shows that clusters of carbon nanopores with a copper core, and its oxides were deposited on the zeolite. For both types of catalysts, the crystallization time of zeolite was investigated, and it was found that this leads to the synthesis of samples with different percentages of crystallinity. For each test, the liquid fuel produced was divided into four cuts: gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and wax. The test results in a fixed bed reactor for every twelve samples of catalyst and their effect on the efficiency of different sections of liquid fuel show a significant improvement in the desired product. The properties and morphology of the catalysts were investigated. It was found that at 400 °C and a crystallization time of 18 h for support with 76.62% crystallinity, gasoline production efficiency will be 37.00%. At 500 °C and low crystallinity, the tendency of reaction to produce jet fuel with a maximum efficiency of 48.64%. Furthermore, the physical properties of each cut of liquid fuel and their comparison with the reported values indicating the appropriate qualities of the produced fuel were evaluated. In the optimal state, the octane number of the produced gasoline is 93.5 and its pour point is 41 °C. Also, a jet fuel with an octane number of 43.2 and a flashpoint of 69 °C has been obtained. In the case of diesel, the octane number and its viscosity have reached 46 and 2.407 cp, respectively. Examining the results obtained from GC MS, it was found that the zeolite catalyst modified by Diels Alder mechanism and branching will improve the quality of liquid fuel and on the other hand, will cause the cracking of the wax compounds and reduce their percentage in product analysis.',\n",

This study investigated the feasibility of low waste emission complete LCW (rice straw (RS), rice husk (RH), and corn straw (CS)) recycling through feeding to Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus larvae (mealworms) using egested frass to produce organic fertilizers. For larvae fed RS, CS, and RH plus nutrients co-diets groups, the 48-day average specific rates of LCW consumption increased by 118.09%, 155.30%, and 87.14%, respectively when compared with that of sole diet groups. The order of the feed consumption rate and conversion rate in a mealworm farm fed on the three LCWs agreed with the trend obtained with lab-scale experiments, with RS＞CS＞RH. The forty-eight days cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin biodegradation increased by 1.48–17.61%, 4.26–11.50%, and 4.20–15.75%, respectively, for co-fed larvae. Enterococcus sp. and Erwinia sp., which previous reports have indicated are strongly associated with lignocellulose degradation, were identified in the gut microbiome of mealworms fed with RS and CS co-diets. Furthermore, the RS-fed frass quickly formed a high-quality compost within 32 days of composting, which had a germination rate ratio of 8% and 17% higher than that of WB and CS-fed frass. LCA (life cycle assessment) proved a relatively promising environmental-friendly alternative to dispose of RS, using their excreted frass for composting with low waste emissions. This study provides new insight into insect-involved crop waste utilization, and economical strategies for sustainable in situ recycling of LCWs into high-value-added products.',\n",

Plastic samples were continuously heated in an aging oven at 100 °C to simulate thermal aging. The pyrolysis volatile compositions of fresh and aged plastic samples were comparatively studied by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) at 500 °C. The volatile composition analysis results showed that thermal aging changes the pyrolysis oil composition, and the influence strongly depends on the type of plastic. For PE and PP, which underwent random scission after thermal aging treatment, the influence of thermal aging on the heavy oil fraction was more obvious than that on the light oil and diesel oil fractions. For PVC samples, the thermal aging process caused structural defects and turned the color of the PVC light yellow. After 128-h thermal aging, the maximum weight loss rate decreased by 35.8%, and the fraction of C5-C9 components and aromatics first increased and then decreased.

The global textile market size was valued at US $961.5 billion in 2019 and is estimated to exhibit a compound annual growth rate of 4.3% from 2020 to 2027 owing to the increased demand for apparels, especially in developing countries according to Grand view research. Waste management of these textiles is a matter of concern of all due to ecological, technological and economical issues. Zero waste management is one of the very crucial aspects of fibres and fibre containing products towards sustainability. The production process of fibres and their products are highly sophisticated and requires a huge set-up and investment. The most imperative is the requirement of energy for the production process. Lucrative waste management of these textiles lies with partial recovery of the utilized energy by means of reuse and recycling of the wastes as much as possible. Safety or protective clothing are in increasing demand in the present society. As these textiles contain hazardous materials and chemicals, their disposal needs careful attention for the environmental safety. Landfilling and incineration comes under least priority than reuse and recycling due to environmental safety issues. Some sort of physical and/or chemical alternation by means of degradation and removal of toxic substances from the post-consumer protective textile wastes is highly essential before the final disposal. This chapter provides an overview of various ways of dealing with textile wastes particularly post-consumer wastes. Special emphasis is given to various protective clothing and technical aspects of their waste management.            ',\n",

This study seeks to provide an alternative greener recycling procedure that is beneficial to society in terms of health and economics through energy storage materials. The study aimed to synthesize and characterize aluminium oxide nanoparticles from waste aluminium foil and its potential applications in fabricating aluminium-ion cell, FAIC. 1 1 Aluminium-ion cell. Aluminium oxide nanoparticles were obtained by co-precipitation of waste aluminium foils at constant annealing room temperature followed by mechanical milling to nanoparticulate range. The particles were then characterized for particle size and phases (X-ray diffraction), functional groups and optical activity (infra-red and ultra-violet-visible spectroscopy respectively). Cell assembling of FAIC was done using a graphite anode while the cathode had a standard and the synthesized aluminium oxide nanoparticles. Sulfuric acid and magnesium sulfate electrolytes were used with two binders; polyacrylate and silicone adhesives. The average synthesis yield was 40.64 ± 19.69%. Most of the particles had a α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 phase with an average size of 63.763 nm and 66.5144 nm for the two polymorphs respectively. There were several OH-groups coupled to Al–O bonds. The optimal absorption peak was λ max = 237 nm corresponding to a band gap of 5.25eV. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited great electrochemical potential, nearing the standard one in most of the parameters. The FAIC potential, current, power densities and polarization curves from sulfuric acid electrolyte and polyacrylate binder were significantly higher to those of magnesium sulfate and silicone binder (P > 0.05).',\n",

Waste can play the role of alternative fuel, partly reducing the environmental footprint in the waste management sector. Waste briquetting is used as a treatment option for improving waste combustion efficiency, as well as its management and handling. This critical review aims at evaluating the potentialities of this method as a possible solution to introduce alternative fuels in developing countries. Totally, 85 scientific articles available from 1999 to 2021 from international databases were reviewed, and a SWOT analysis has been conducted following the indications underlined in the scientific literature. The outcomes of the review highlight that agricultural waste-based and wood-based briquettes are the most investigated, followed by plastics-based briquettes and paper & cardboard-based briquettes. Waste-based briquettes can be divided into three categories, function of the calorific value: biomass-based (16.22 ± 1.65 MJ kg−1), wood-based (19.03 ± 2.46 MJ kg−1), and plastics and charcoal-based briquettes (24.64 ± 5.29 MJ kg−1). Review findings underline that in-door emissions analysis is lacking, as well as research related to the water boiling test for the valorisation of waste briquetting for cooking and heating systems in developing countries.

The product of such a reaction, while maintaining the specific conditions of the process, acquires an attribute of a lightweight composite aggregate. Two production technologies case studies based on various synthesis mechanisms and reaction centers, as well as different temperature regimes were adopted to design the most optimal method. As a matrix in the created composite the flakes from recycling of a post-consumer thermoplastic polymer PET (polyethylene terephthalate) were used. The composite filler’s role was fulfilled by several fine-grained anthropogenic raw materials. As a result of the experiments, various lightweight aggregates product lines were manufactured and their physical-chemical basic properties examined and mutually contrasted. The created products differed in performance in function of the adopted method and filler material. The obtained granulate is a specific and a unique type of lightweight aggregates denominated, for this purpose, as a composite lightweight aggregate - CLA. The main advantage of the proposed technology implies less heat energy to be supplied in comparison with the existing methods for obtaining such building materials from the waste resources. The other benefit is related to the aspect of its sustainable development performed by using exclusively waste materials for its production. As shown by the research results obtained of the basic characteristics of the aggregate, the produced material can be a full-fledged replacement of a natural aggregate. Some features of this material, such as a lower density or a reduced water demand of the resultant mix, are additional avails, when applied for cementitious building materials. Thanks to this, it is possible to manufacture lighter elements with a lower cement content and also without declining the main mechanical properties.',\n",

The traditional plastic waste treatments rely on high-energy input and are environmentally unfriendly. The emergence of nanocatalyzed chemical upcycling of plastic waste approaches, aiming to convert wastes to value-added chemicals, is encouraging and may enable a circular-plastics economy. Thus, in this Review, we first briefly summarize the background of the plastic waste treatments by introducing the most common plastic types and the traditional treatment methods. We then review the chemical upcycling of plastics in terms of nanocatalyzed pyrolysis, pyrolysis-gasification, solvolysis, hydrocracking and the light/electrochemical-induced processes from a historical account to recent achievements. Coordination chemistry aspects are emphasized in these processes, particularly in the plastics depolymerization mechanism. Emphasis is placed on highlighting the encouraging results recently obtained, especially on the rational design of nanocatalysts with tunable active metals, size, support, and coordination environments for improved catalytic performances. Indications towards further research and applications for value-added products synthesis are also proposed. In addition, some other emerging technologies for waste plastic treatments are introduced.

       " {'context': 'Current interest in reusing waste polymer shows substantial benefits of using it as a sustainable polymer in improving asphalt properties, attaining environmental stability and promoting industrial-economic benefits. Waste plastics have a vital role in the current asphalt applications. Trial sections of roads made with waste plastic modified asphalt, during 2019 in Australia, highlighted the significant importance of laboratory assessments yet to be conducted. As such, this study is aimed to investigate the impact of using local waste Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plastic in binder class C320, which is a common bitumen type used for local road surfacing in Australia. The evaluation of various contents of PET modified bitumen is carried out through two stages for unaged and aged conditions. Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFOT) and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) tests were utilised to investigate the rutting, fatigue and aging of bitumen binder. The results showed that the ideal content of waste plastic is 6–8% to improve the rutting and aging resistances. Moreover, 8% PET improves the fatigue cracking resistance as it shows a low fatigue factor (G* sin δ). Hence, application of locally-attained plastic in pavements not only reduces the costs but also improve sustainability of environment and natural resources. Further rutting and fatigue tests on asphalt samples are recommended to better understand the mechanical properties of PET plastic on asphalt mixtures with 6–8% PET plastic. In the event that the outcomes demonstrate an enhancement in the properties of the concrete paving mixture, usage of such a material would be extremely compensating in Australia. Also, this would help decrease the amount of waste scrap plastic, in turn, sustaining the environment.',\n",

To achieve sustainability in the industry, waste materials have been applied in construction composites such as bricks and cement/concrete mortar to reduce the dependency on non-renewable resources. This review focuses on the application of waste plastics and coal fly ash in building and construction composites, especially bricks. The properties (e.g., mechanical strength, water resistance and thermal stability) of the waste-derived composites were evaluated to ascertain their applicability in the construction industry. Nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are known to possess high mechanical strength have been identified as suitable filler materials to provide the desired strength to the final products such as bricks. The dispersion of the CNTs in the composite is at a finer scale, compared to conventional fillers. Thus, extremely low contents of CNTs can make a substantial difference in enhancing the properties of the composites. The waste-derived composites enhanced with CNTs are lightweight strong materials that can withstand harsh conditions of weather, fire or earth tremors. Moreover, the environmental concerns on the release of CNTs from the composite are reviewed to ensure their sustainable application.',\n",

In this review, the environmental occurrences, emission characteristics, sources, and possible adverse effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from primitive e-waste dismantling activities are summarized. In general, the atmospheric levels of PAHs at typical e-waste sites, e.g., in Guiyu, China, have substantially decreased by more than an order of magnitude compared with levels a decade ago. The PAH concentrations in soil from old e-waste sites in China are also generally lower than those at newly emerged e-waste sites in India, Pakistan and Ghana. However, elevated concentrations of PAHs have been reported in human milk, hair and urine from the populations near these e-waste sites. Source apportionment both from bench-scale studies to field observations has demonstrated that the pyrolysis and combustion processing of electronic circuit board are mainly responsible for the emissions of various PAHs. In addition, some specific PAHs and their derivatives, such as triphenylbenzene, halogenated and oxygenated PAHs, have frequently been identified and could be considered as indicators in routine analysis in addition to the 16 U.S. EPA priority PAHs currently used.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The need for developing renewable materials to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels as a feedstock for a wide variety of uses is becoming increasingly widely acknowledged in society. Chitin, the second most abundant nitrogenous natural polymer derived from renewable biomass resources, have attracted significant interest as a promising natural source to produce functional materials due to their unique properties, abundant availability, and environmental appeal. Chitin is present in huge amounts in seafood waste, which is severely underutilized, resulting in resource wastage. An appealing alternative is to upcycle chitin-containing trash into value-added goods, to meet the sustainable development requirements. Since the large quantities of seafood waste remain underexploited, their utilization can potentially bring both ecological and economic benefits. The present review discusses the general properties of chitin and chitosan as natural polysaccharides, highlighting the innovative and eco-friendly methods for recovery of chitin and its derivatives from waste sources. The recent trends of the application of chitin and chitosan in various sectors are explored, highlighting the nexus between the generation and management of seafood waste and its transformation into valuable commercial products as a solution.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Sustainable stabilization/solidification (S/S) incorporating biochar for hazardous wastes has attracted increasing attention. In this study, contaminated marine sediments were remediated and recycled as useful materials via cement-based S/S process incorporating iron-biochar composites derived from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) and peanut shell. Results showed that incorporation of 20% iron-biochar composites notably increased the Cr immobilization (52.8% vs 92.1–99.7%), while attained similar As (70%) and Cu (95%) immobilization efficiencies compared to the control group (CK) prepared with plain cement as the binder based on the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure. S/S products with the addition of ISSA derived iron-biochar composite had a mechanical strength of 5.0 MPa, which was significantly higher than its counterparts derived from pure iron oxide or pristine biochar (< 4.5 MPa). Microstructural and spectroscopic characterizations and chemical leaching experiments demonstrated that reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) followed by formation of Cr-Fe precipitates by zero valent iron in iron-biochar composites contributed to the enhanced immobilization efficacy of Cr(VI) compared to CK. Overall, these results demonstrated the potential of applying ISSA and peanut shell derived iron-biochar composites as additives in the cement-based S/S treatment for contaminated sediments.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The incorporation of waste materials in asphalt mixtures has driven several studies mainly focused on improving their mechanical performance while minimizing the use of virgin materials. However, these could only be considered cleaner solutions for road paving works if their production and application do not present additional risks for human health and the environment. Therefore, this study aims at assessing the carbon dioxide emissions and possible leachates of stone mastic asphalt mixtures produced with high rates of different waste materials for binder modification or material recycling. Thus, a chemical analysis of eluates that were in contact with those mixtures and an estimation of the carbon dioxide emissions associated with their production and transportation were carried out under different scenarios. In conclusion, these mixtures comply with the established specifications for hazardous leachates. The addition of waste materials to these mixtures decreases carbon dioxide emissions, especially for recycled stone mastic asphalt mixtures with 50% reclaimed asphalt pavement material and bitumens modified with waste materials. Thus, the studied mixtures are innovative solutions for future use in pavement maintenance and rehabilitation operations, in line with the circular economy concept.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Crop protection residual plastic films are a growing environmental problem which requires efficient solutions. Their suitability as matrices for obtaining sustainable eco-composites reinforced with industrially-sourced residual natural fibers was investigated in order to boost their recovery and prevent waste generation. The analysis of the studied residual agricultural plastics revealed that they are low density polyethylene still containing significant amounts of ethylene-vinyl acetate (2.5–4.5 wt%). A pilot–plant extrusion-compounding technology was applied to a selected recycled plastic from residual agricultural films and the residual cellulose fibers for obtaining the eco-composites. The effects of cellulose-fiber content and a selected maleic anhydride-modified polyethylene coupling agent on the properties and interfacial adhesion of the eco-composites were investigated. By using micromechanical models, scientific data of the intrinsic modulus and strength of the Eucalyptus Globulus residual fibers, hitherto scarcely available in literature, were found to be 16.4 GPa and 180 MPa, respectively, thus revealing their suitability as cost-effective reinforcement. Tensile modulus and strength of the eco-composites were up to 667% and 70% greater than those of the neat agricultural recycled plastic, the latter due to the enhanced compatibility provided by the ethylene-vinyl acetate found. When the coupling agent was added, tensile and flexural strengths increased up to a maximum of 20.26 MPa and 23.96 MPa, respectively. Property variations were found to be due to the fiber length reduction and the interfacial adhesion improvement caused by the coupling agent as well as to its plasticizing effect. The properties achieved revealed the suitability of the eco-composites for their immediate application in the production of numerous environmentally sustainable and cost-effective end-products from the aforementioned wastes.',\n",

We investigated the effects of graphene addition on the rheology, thermal and mechanical properties of a prime high-density polyethylene (prime HDPE) with post-industrial recycled HDPE (recHDPE) blends. The viscosity and mechanical results, along with scanning electron microscopy analysis suggests that graphene acts as a reinforcing filler, thermal stabilizer, and potential compatibilizer for the blends of prime/recHDPE. The experimental findings showed that the addition of graphene resulted in a significant morphology refinement that facilitated replacing up to 50% of a prime HDPE with recHDPE, without compromising the mechanical performance.',\n",

Expansive soils are known for their volume change during different seasons, while plastic waste is the most hazardous waste pollutant material that causes damage to the environment and organisms. Utilizing plastic wastes in subgrade construction reduces the quantity of waste and improves the problematic behavior of expansive soils. The studied soil is categorized as expansive clay soil according to the AASHTO soil classification system. Various geotechnical laboratory tests were conducted by varying the plastic strip sizes with treatment percentages of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%. The study found that swelling percentages and compaction parameters were decreased with an increase in plastic waste strips. As percentages of plastic strips increase, CBR values increase while unconfined compressive strength increases up to 0.5% addition of plastic strips and then slightly decreasing. The cohesion of the soil increases up to 1.5% of plastic strips addition. The study recommends that the utilization of plastic waste in subgrade road construction is the best alternative to improve the strength of expansive soils and reduce environmental pollution.',\n",

The small number of items of WEEE retrieved (n\\u202f=\\u202f36) were largely restricted to wiring insulation and constructed of lead-stabilised polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Among the remaining samples, Br, Cd, Cr and Pb were commonly detected in all categories of black plastics (n\\u202f=\\u202f264) with maximum concentrations of 43,400\\u202fmg\\u202fkg−1, 2080\\u202fmg\\u202fkg−1, 662\\u202fmg\\u202fkg−1 and 23,800\\u202fmg\\u202fkg−1, respectively. Moreover, concentrations of Br were significantly correlated with concentrations of the flame retardant synergist, Sb (n\\u202f=\\u202f22), and 35 samples were potentially non-compliant with regard to limits defined by the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive. For plastics of other colours (n\\u202f=\\u202f224), Br and Pb were detected in fewer samples and Br was co-associated with Sb in only two cases, with occasional high concentrations Cd, Cr and Pb largely attributed to the historical use of cadmium sulphide and lead chromate pigments. An avian physiologically-based extraction test applied to selected samples cut to mm-dimensions revealed bioaccessibilities ranging from <0.1% for Cr in a green fragment to about 2.4% (or about 580\\u202fmg\\u202fkg−1) for Pb in black PVC.

       " {'context': '                  Failure in appropriately managing complex municipal solid waste systems in general and waste plastics in particular negatively affects public health and environment.                  A decision-making tool incorporating concepts of logistics and supply chain, considering different types of waste was developed. A multi-objective, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, focusing on the plastic recycling network, incorporating features of multimodal transportation was implemented. The model aims at minimizing net present cost (NPC) and environmental impacts, illustrated by a case study of a Swiss waste treatment cluster. A reference situation was used for benchmarking and 7 new scenarios considered - corresponding to different plastics collection configurations.                  From the solutions space, designs arise that lead to a 2-fold decrease of NPC at the expense of increasing by 20 % current emissions, as well as solutions that provide small net gains in environmental aspects - close to 3 %, albeit a 4-fold increase in NPC due to large investments in recycling facilities and increased transportation costs.                  This work sheds light on the impact of supply chain and logistics aspects on the separate collection and treatment of waste plastics, in the context of a real municipal waste treatment policy, where a thermodynamic model to deal with the conversion processes is integrated into the general supply chain decision. As a result, important insights to guide decision-makers were obtained.               ',\n",

In this study, the pyrolysis of light or heavy density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and their mixture with the biochar produced from gasification of poplar wood as catalyst was investigated. The results showed that, during the co-pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE in absence or presence of biochar catalyst, cross-interaction of reaction intermediates originated from the degradation of LDPE and HDPE substantially promoted the formation of gaseous products and the evolution of heavy organics with π-conjugated structures in the tar. During the pyrolysis of HDPE, more heavy tar while less wax was produced, while it was contrary during the pyrolysis of LDPE. In the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, the volatiles could be effectively cracked over the biochar catalyst, forming more gases, while in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, instead of catalyzing the cracking of the heavy components, the biochar catalyzed the polymerisation reactions. The properties of the biochar catalyst in terms of crystallinity, surface functionality, and internal structures also changed remarkably due to the transfer of oxygen-containing species from the polyethylene to biochar and the interaction of biochar with volatiles in the pyrolysis.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Soaring consumption of plastic products globally generates vast amount of plastic wastes, which has been a grand challenge for today's solid waste management system. China has been the world largest importer of plastic wastes for the last three decades. However, due to growing environmental awareness, China decided to stop importing plastic wastes in 2017. This study analyzes the historical evolution of the international plastic wastes trade by using complex network analysis method and shows that China's management policies are the main driving forces to the expansion and shrinkage of the global plastic wastes trade network. We find that the trade network grew most tremendously during mid-1990s to early 2010s. The global total trade volume increased from 0.9 million tons in 1992 to 16.4 million tons in 2012, and the number of trade connections increased from 452 to 2248 during the same period. 2–6% of the trade relations contributed more than 80% of the global total trade volumes. Trade flows among continents or sub-continental regions increased from 38% to 64% during 1997–2012, indicating longer transport distances and spatially more separated trade partners in the network. Results also show that the growth trend stagnated and the network became multipolar again after 2012, when China launched a series of campaigns to strengthen regulations on solid wastes import. China's import ban on plastic wastes issued in 2017 led to a dramatic decline of trade volumes. More and more stringent environmental protection measures in China and other developing countries are transforming the geographic pattern of global waste trade network and may drive developed countries to reconstruct their recycling systems.\",\n",

The produced terephthalamides from chemical recycling of PET were further utilized as reactants for fabrication of plastic films by a radical thiol-ene reaction or they were evaluated as plasticizers for polylactide (PLA). The chemical recycling by aminolysis was performed with four different amines: allylamine, ethanolamine, furfurylamine or hexylamine. The microwave-assisted process led selectively to good yields of well-defined terephthalamides with different terminal functional groups depending on the used amine. The reaction time varied from 10 to 60 min. The end-product obtained after aminolysis with allylamine was further reacted with a thiol through a radical thiol-ene reaction, producing good quality films with glass transition temperature (Tg) above room temperature. The three other terephthalamides were mixed with PLA at 10 wt% and evaluated as plasticizers. The terephthalamide produced by aminolysis with furfurylamine, increased the strain at break 20 times compared to the strain at break of neat PLA. The results illustrate that chemical recycling of PET by aminolysis is a viable and versatile option, producing a library of valuable chemical compounds ready for further use in material applications.',\n",

After a brief outline relating to environmental benefits, involvements in economy, legislation, reliability, and performance concerns, the various methods of recycling are examined from mechanical to thermal recycling through chemical, solvent technologies, and enzymatic depolymerization.               Rheology, mechanical performances, aging resistance, flammability, and color can be improved thanks to upgrading formulations with traditional or special additives.

Recycling of thermosets, composites, fibers, and high-performance polymers are approached.               A special attention on environmental advantages of recycling is paid to CO2 emission, greenhouse effects, and carbon footprints.

A solvent that can be used is from oil plastic pyrolysis as an alternative additive. Plastics are now an inseparable item from daily necessities and are the largest pollutant on the environment. Plastic is a polymer that is difficult to be decomposed, and one way to decompose it is through pyrolysis or thermal cracking. This research studies the quality effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics waste on the quantity and quality of oil yield produced through the pyrolysis process in the three reactor outlets. LDPE plastics waste used was distinguished: LDPE-White, LDPE Mixed-plastic, and LDPE Blend-plastic. The results showed that, in the process of plastic pyrolysis LDPE, in addition to affecting the yield of produced oil, the quality of plastic is also influenced by the length of time of pyrolysis. The better the quality of the plastic is, the higher the oil yield and the shorter the pyrolysis times are. LDPE plastic pyrolysis at 250 °C produces the maximum yield. Most oil yields, namely 99.78%, 75.60%, and 50.29% were produced by LDPE white plastics, mixed plastics, and blend plastics, respectively, when pyrolyzed for 110, 180, and 270 min. The economic yields of each plastic of 88.78%, 60.68%, and 40.35% were generated if each was hydrolyzed for 60, and 80 min.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The effect of recycling on the thermo-mechanical and water absorption behavior of polypropylene (PP)/sisal fiber and polylactic acid (PLA)/sisal fiber composites were studied. The PP-based non-biodegradable composites and PLA-based biodegradable composites were recycled for four times. The effect of recycling was determined by examining the morphology, thermo-mechanical properties, and water absorption behavior and the obtained results were compared. The results showed that the incorporation of sisal fibers in the PP and PLA matrix enhances the tensile modulus and percentage crystallinity of the composites. The tensile strength and modulus of the sisal fiber reinforced PP composites were not affected with recycling. Even though the tensile properties of PLA and PLA/sisal fiber reinforced composites are superior to PP and PP/sisal fiber composites, the PLA-based composites show a dramatic decrease in tensile strength and modulus after the first recycling due to the degradation of the polymer. The thermal stability of the PP/sisal fiber composites was not affected by the repeated recycling process. On the other hand, the PLA-based composites with higher sisal fiber content show a bit lower thermal stability after recycling. The PP-based composites show fluctuations in percentage crystallinity with recycling. On the other hand, a remarkable increase in percentage crystallinity for PLA and PLA-based composites was observed with increasing recycling times. Water diffusion study divulges that the diffusion of water into the polymer composites was reduced with recycling, irrespective of the polymer matrix.',\n",

Fortunately, among many methods to deal with the problem of increasing polymer debris in the environment, pyrolysis stands out due to its efficiency and accessibility. In the present study, automobile plastic scrap (APS) and tyre crumb rubber (TCR) materials as a combination were subjected to co-pyrolysis using a novel catalyst (NOVC-FZP) that was synthesized using ferrocene and zeolite as precursors. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the raw materials (APS and TCR) shows single-stage decomposition at 402 °C and 340 °C, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis confirms higher production of the hydrocarbon (HC) groups in the oil with NOVC-FZP as compared to the neat oil (without NOVC-FZP). The cetane index of the oil with NOVC-FZP was found to be 22 and the calorific value of the same was 9162 Cal/g. A very high proportion of gasoline (86.8% of oil) was found in the oil resulting from the catalyzed pyrolysis. Solid product char (SPC) obtained through pyrolysis was incorporated into linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to form LLDPE/SPC composite (LCC) for use in several applications rather than disposing it off. Higher mechanical properties like tensile strength, hardness as well as enhanced dielectric constant were exhibited by the prepared LCC.',\n",

       " {'context': 'To promote the sustainable development of single-used polyethylene (PE) commodity plastic for long-lasting use in advanced electronic devices, this work presented a successful strategy for converting PE plastic bags, which usually end up in landfills, into specifically flexible and transparent triboelectric tactile sensors (TES). In order to enhance the electrical output to meet the practical application, liquid phase electrolytes (LPEs) were introduced between double sides of thin PE layers. LPE utilization had significant influence on the output signal, resulting in an effective response to physical contact with the human hand. The effect of LPE types, i.e., acids, salts and solvent as well as concentration, on output signal was studied and clarified. The scientific working mechanism for PE/LPE TES was described based on the coupling behavior between contact electrification, electrostatic induction and ion conduction within the electric double layer. The PE/LPE TES showed the optimized signal response of V oc ~1.6 V, I sc ~673 nA and 450 W/cm2, enabled by tunable LPE types and concentrations, thus providing a hundred times more than that of pristine PE. By integrating PE/LPE TES with a signal-processing circuit, wireless application of the complete tactile sensing system has been developed further to make contact with and control home appliances such as a light bulb and an electric fan. Its flexibility and transparency has great potential adaptation for the active tactile system that can be attached to different wearable devices, textiles, or home interior decoration. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for promoting PE plastic as a high value-added electronic product that has the potential to pave the way for development in large-scale industry, and help in treating used plastic in the future. It also has the opportunity to obtain a tactile sensor that is affordable and cost-effective in making a valuable contribution in the global sensor market, thus ensuring sustainable development in both social and economic terms.',\n",

Therefore, feasibility of the usage of single used plastic (PET and PE) made aggregates in M20 and M25 grade cement concrete as partial replacement of natural coarse and fine aggregate were studied in this research work with 8 volumetric substitution levels (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 35 %, and 40 %) The influence of substitution on fresh and hardened properties of concrete was assessed by analyzing workability, wet and dry density, compressive strength at different ages and split tensile strength. The experimental results indicate that both the densities decrease about 10 % and workability increases about 60 % with increase in the ratio of plastic aggregate. Compressive strength and split tensile strength decrease with increase in plastic replacement upto 14 % and 34 % respectively. Based on the experimental results models were developed using four different Machine learning (ML) techniques namely ANN, FL, ANFIS and GA to predict the workability, density and compressive strength of the waste plastic aggregate based concrete. The result clearly signifies that the ANFIS model yields the best result (R2 =0.98) for predicting the properties of concrete accurately. Furthermore, GA based multi-objective optimization models were developed using different aggregates for obtaining concrete with maximum workability and compressive strength along with minimum density and cost.',\n",

However, polymeric foam waste gasification has not been addressed well and needs to be developed, particularly because of the large volume of such waste produced especially from polyurethane foams. In this regard, air and steam gasification processes for rigid and flexible polyurethane foam wastes were modeled and subjected to multi-objective optimization utilizing a response surface methodology. A multi-criteria decision analysis using TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) was employed to select the gasification process with the best performance with respect to the maximum hydrogen energy and total energy efficiencies and the minimum normalized carbon dioxide emission. It was found that flexible polyurethane foam waste gasification using a steam gasifying agent was the best alternative. Flexible polyurethane foam waste gasification using steam gasifying agent at its optimum conditions resulted in a hydrogen energy efficiency of 48.5%, a total energy efficiency of 82.1% and a normalized carbon dioxide emission of 1.69 g. mol−1, based on the feedstock entering the system.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this study, the effects of CO2 thermochemical agent and a metal oxide catalyst (Co3O4) on thermochemical banner waste conversion were explored. The results revealed that compared to the non-catalytic conversion of banner waste under N2 environment, the conversion under CO2 yielded more non-condensable gases owing to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles. In addition, the CO and CH4 yields at >700 °C in CO2 increased considerably owing to the reverse water–gas shift reaction and CO2 methanation. The CO2 agent reduced the yields of condensables (e.g., benzoic acids, phthalic acids, esters, biphenyls, fluorenes) and decomposition residue (e.g., char and wax), which could be attributed to the enhancement of the thermal cracking of volatiles evolved during the banner waste conversion by CO2 and the C–H and O–H bonds present in the feedstock. In addition, the Co3O4 catalyst promoted the decarboxylation reaction under N2 environment, whereas it promoted the methanation and reverse water–gas shift reaction under CO2. This indicates that compared to the non-catalytic CO2-assisted banner waste conversion, the use of CO2 for the conversion of banner waste in the presence of Co3O4 significantly increased the yields of CH4 and CO. Furthermore, Co3O4 promoted the thermal cracking of polyester bond, thus decreasing the yields of long-chain chemical compounds. In addition, the simultaneous use of Co3O4 catalyst and CO2 agent minimized the formation of char and wax. For all cases (N2 versus CO2, non-catalytic versus catalytic), an increase in temperature enhanced the total permanent gas yield and decreased the yields of condensables, char, and wax. The findings of this study revealed the importance of the synergistic use of Co3O4 catalyst and CO2 agent for the plastic waste upcycling, such as banner waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Providing a valuable application to the under-utilized solid residue of co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics could substantially improve economic and environmental sustainability of the process, thereby fostering circular economy. This study focuses on the variation of thermal and physiochemical characteristics of solid char, produced from the co -pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene (WLDPE) and Eucalyptus wood with varying pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 550 °C, residence times of 90–150 min, and relative percentage of 33% and 25% (w/w) WLDPE in the feedstock. The highest values of yield (37%), energy density (1.25) and high heat value (31 MJ/Kg) were observed with the char produced at 300 °C. The physical inhibition caused by the overlaying plastic coating on the surface of the char below 450 °C resulted in the same. However, with the increase in temperature, increase in fuel ratio by 78–79% and fixed carbon content by 68–69% were observed. The highest concentrations of fixed carbon (39%), fuel ratio (0.81) along with the lowest O/C and H/C ratios (0.07 and 0.13) were observed with the chars produced above 450 °C depicting their high degree of carbonization. The fuel value indices of all the chars were > 500 GJ/m3 indicating their suitability as high-quality fuels. Significant influences of residence time and feedstock ratio were also observed on properties of the char. The analysis of variance and principal component analysis also depicted significant variations in the properties of the char produced below and above the temperatures of 450 °C due to the inhibitory and synergetic effects. While the chars produced at 300–350 °C could be used for combustion/co-combustion in coal-fired boilers, chars produced above 450 °C can be opted as household fuel due to their low losses of energy, water vapour, and smoke during combustion.',\n",

The present paper shows results of practical investigation of the Real-Time Material Flow Monitoring in a large-scale Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) production plant and a semi large-scale processing line (Technical line 4.0) using mixed solid waste. The investigations aimed to research the fundamentals for generating mass flow data from volume flow data and volume and mass flow data from shredder power consumption. It could be shown that a mass determination from volume flow data with the help of density determinations can be practically realized in a good approximation (deviation < 1%) to the gravimetrically determined mass in an SRF production plant. With R2 = 0.47, the power consumption of a shredder in the SRF plant shows a low to medium correlation to the corresponding volume flow. In the 31 tests with the Technical Line 4.0, both, the mass flow and the volume flow could be measured in real-time. Combining these data results in the temporal density curve and shows strong fluctuations for shredded commercial waste. Comparing the mean bulk densities for each test with those from the density determinations of taken samples shows a robust correlation (R2 = 0.82). Analyzes of the material composition of the shredded mixed solid waste show strong correlations to bulk density for the proportions of the fractions rest (positive correlation) and plastics (negative correlation).',\n",

In this paper, waste fibers were adopted and carded into even fiber web, followed by needle-punching technology with several layers of fiber web to strengthen the plant medium with satisfying mechanical properties. Then, the grafting modification was conducted on the needle-punched nonwoven geotextiles and the optimum combination of grafting factors were obtained via orthogonal experiments. The tensile, heavy metal adsorption and plant cultivation performances of modified and untreated plant medium were systematically compared and analyzed by infrared absorption spectrum, SEM, XRD, TG, ICP-OES, universal material testing machine, and contact angle tester. The results showed that β-cyclodextrin was well grafted on the substrate. The orthogonal experiments results showed that the best combination of Pb2+ and Cu2+ adsorption was 4% sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 2% β-cyclodextrin, 170 °C heating temperature, and 50 min heating. The adsorption effects of Pb2+ and Cu2+ were 14.32 mg/g and 38.99 mg/g, respectively. The grafted fabric was hydrophilic and a more suitable culture medium for plants. These results provide not only a novel solution for reuse of recycled fibers but also a feasible strategy to construct a new water ecosystem.',\n",

In this work, repairable, recyclable, removable, and hydrophobic UV-curable polyurethane coatings derived from renewable castor oil were constructed by the employment of dynamic hindered urea bonds (HUBs). The resulting UV-curable materials not only showed high biobased contents (45.1%–47.6%), but also exhibited good thermal, mechanical, coating, and hydrophobic performance (a T g of 67.0–77.8 °C, a tensile strength up to 16.6 MPa, a pencil hardness of 3H–5H, a flexibility of 2 mm, a water contact angle of 90.8–105.9°, etc.). Furthermore, due to the rapid dissociation or exchange of HUBs and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the resulting UV-curable coatings exhibited excellent repairability, weldability, recyclability, and removability at moderate temperatures. For instance, the selected sample (PU-Si2) demonstrated a scratch healing efficiency up to 97.0% at 140 °C for 60 min and a welding efficiency (tensile strength) of 91.3% at 120 °C for 60 min. In particular, the UV-cured PU-Si2 sample could be physically recycled at least 4 times with enhanced performance in tensile properties, and the resulting PU-Si2 coatings were easily removed or recycled by using low-toxicity organic solvents like ethyl acetate and dimethylformamide.',\n",

Well-segregated wastes are necessary in this context. A compost bin is a waste collection tool for source separation. To date, the deployment of compost bins for source separation has received scant investigation. This study investigated the effects of compost bin design in terms of user design preferences, waste collection and sorting execution, and segregation behavior. The study comprised a survey and an on-site experiment. Design preferences of nine designed compost bins were evaluated by surveying 400 respondents using the pairwise comparison method. It was revealed that design preference was determined by bin shape and slot position. On-site experiments were conducted to establish collection rate, contamination rate, capture rate, and effective capture rate under different conditions. Under the experimental conditions, better segregation rates were observed in comparison with the control condition. The contamination rate was reduced by 55.9%. The capture rate and the effective capture rate were increased by 8.90%, and 53.4%, respectively. The significant effects of design preferences, physical designs, visual prompts, and past behavior were identified via statistical methods. Source-separated waste collection can be improved through preferred compost bin adoption, enhanced design, appropriate visual prompts, and experience in waste segregation. Therefore, the findings of this study will help to generate effective source-separated collection and allow compost bins to be placed in public areas for integrated and sustainable waste management.',\n",

In this work, memory boards obsolete with 0.053 wt% Ag were used. The extraction of all metals studied (Ag, Al, Cu, Fe, Ni, Sn, and Zn) involved the evaluation of the Pourbaix and speciation diagrams to identify the pH and redox potential conditions, considering the possible species formed with leaching agents: sulfuric, nitric, and hydrochloric medium. After the definition of the leaching agent, the extraction routes by hydrometallurgical processing were proposed from the parameters of temperature, s/l ratio, and reaction time previously studied. Route A was composed of sequential stages (the first leaching in a sulfuric medium and the second in an oxidizing sulfuric medium) and obtained 100% of Ag recovery. Route B consisted only of leaching in an oxidizing sulfuric medium, obtained about 94% of the Ag recovery, and could not contribute to the subsequent purification steps (if necessary) of this solution, as all metals would also be in the solution. These two routes showed that Ag can only be recovered in an oxidizing sulfuric acid medium, according to the conditions studied. Ag recovered in the leach liquor of the second stage of Route A was purified by chemical precipitation with NaCl, and the AgCl was solubilized in an NH4OH solution.

       " {'context': 'A methodology has been developed to apply value chain analysis (VCA) to the informal recycling sector, and demonstrated using the Zabaleen in Cairo, Egypt as a case study. The VCA methodology provides a \\u2ffftoolkit\\u2fff comprising four stages. The first involves mapping the value chain and has been demonstrated using the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles as the particular example. Stage 2 tabulates the value added at each step in the value chain; this has been demonstrated for different types of plastics as well as other recycled fractions. Stage 3 identifies and then applies a set of indicators for the development of the informal sector recycling value chain in order to address technical and socio-economic challenges. The indicators proposed are in three categories: connections in the value chain, waste valorisation and the enabling environment. Stage 4 involves developing a system dynamic map that shows connections between the indicators, and the stocks and flow variables in the value chain. In particular, it identifies the most highly connected indicators on which to focus interventions, as these are likely to have the greatest impact on the overall system. For the Zabaleen, these are improving the quality of waste inputs into the value chain through source segregation, optimising access to waste and upgrading recycling activities through access to finance and technical knowledge.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The worldwide solid waste composition indicates that polymeric materials account for, approximately, 10 % of municipal solid waste (MSW). After sorting, MSW still contains a fraction of plastic (Municipal Plastic Waste - MPW) which is a potential raw material for thermochemical processes. Among the thermochemical processes, combustion, pyrolysis and gasification are the most important. This study reports the steam gasification process of the MPW after the MSW sorting of the selective collection in the municipality of Garibaldi, southern Brazil. The samples were obtained after the separation of materials intended for recycling. A total of 29.8 % of the MSW after sorting was found to be made of polymeric materials incorrectly sent to landfill. The MPW was characterized by gravimetric composition, particle size distribution, ultimate and proximate analyzes. The polymeric materials with the highest participation in MPW are polypropylene (28.77 %), polystyrene (23.53 %) and polyethylene (16.67 %). The gasification experiments were carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at different temperatures (800, 850 and 900 °C), by using steam as gasification agent (0.3 kg/h). Gasification experiments were also performed with calcium oxide (CaO). The remaining ash had its morphology analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), while gas from steam gasification was evaluated between 0−90 min by Gas Chromatography (GC). The steam gasification of MPW with CaO increased both dry gas yield and hydrogen yield. The maximum dry gas yield (3.12 Nm3/kgMPW) was obtained at 900 °C with CaO, as well as a high H2 yield (104 mol/kgMPW). This energy reuse can help to reduce energy demand bottlenecks, as well as the decrease of landfills.',\n",

Biodegradable films of different composition were prepared and compared with virgin LDPE film. The effect of detergent solution, mustard oil, petroleum oil and saline water was determined as per ASTMD 543-67 to assess its durability. The chemical resistance of the film under 10% HCl and 10% NaOH was also checked. The developed biodegradable film of composition 60:30:10 by weight of LDPE:starch:additive showed a tensile strength of 16.2MPa and elongation at break of 140% indicating that only 10–12% loss of tensile strength and 15% loss in impact strength can be observed by incorporating just 30% starch as compared to virgin LDPE film. The application of the biodegradable film as an environmental friendly packaging material can be effectively judged by its decrease in tensile strength and elongation at break by 8% and 2% respectively by addition of just 10% starch under soil burial condition whereas the burst strength has increased by 16% which makes it to be extensively applicable for packaging.',\n",

In this paper, a novel and simple approach for strengthening the mortar layer of RCA by treatment with a crystallizing agent (CA) was proposed, and the effects of different treatment regime on the density, water absorption, mineral composition, and microstructure of RCA were determined. Moreover, the performance of CA-treated RCA in recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) was investigated, and its mechanism of the treatment was explored at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. The results showed that CA treatment significantly improved the overall performance of RCA by increasing the density and calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) content, which enhanced the properties of the new and old interfacial transition zones and enhanced the mechanical properties of the RAC. The improvements were attributed to the reaction of CA with calcium-rich hydration products in the mortar layer of RCA, which formed C–S–H precipitates. The newly-formed C–S–H filled the pores of RCA and blocked cracks, which improved the compactness of the RCA.',\n",

The recycled carbon fibres were coated by five different concentrations of waterborne polyurethane (WBPU) bonded with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The chemical bonding between the fibres and the coating and their morphological structures are demonstrated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Furthermore, the single fibre tensile tests showed the enhancement of tensile strength and Young's modulus results after the coating. The thermal stability of the coated fibres was changed significantly compared to the uncoated fibres and the contact angle of their surface was reduced dramatically. The measured contact angles between the single fibres and the resin decreased from 70° to 40°. The epoxy-based composites were manufactured by the vacuum infusion method at room temperature. Significant improvements were attained in the tensile and flexural properties of the composites reinforced by coated fibres. The tensile and flexural strength of the mentioned composites were enhanced by up to 107% and 68%, respectively. Fractography confirmed the strong adhesion between the coated fibres and the matrix. Eventually, the impact resistivity of the fabricated composites was improved by approximately 49%.\",\n",

However, this permanent crosslinking structure brings the dilemma that the rubber materials cannot be recycled after the life cycle, which causes energy waste and serious environmental pollution. Herein, we present a facile and green methodology to prepare covalently cross-linked yet recyclable and robust polyisoprene-based vitrimer. The carboxylated carbon nanodots (CNDs) were selected as both cross-linkers and reinforcing components to react with epoxidized polyisoprene (EPI) for the construction of dynamic cross-linked networks with exchangeable β-hydroxyl ester bonds for the first time. The dynamic covalent linkages endowed the EPI-based vitrimers with reprocessability and excellent shape memory performance. In addition, the dynamic exchangeable interface enables CNDs well-dispersed in the EPI matrix, which exhibited high reinforcement efficiency on the mechanical properties of EPI composite.',\n",

Herein, we developed a rapid analytical method using a gas chromatograph coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry or electron capture detection to simultaneously detect PBDEs and HBCD in plastic waste. PBDEs and HBCD were ultrasonically extracted from plastic samples using toluene. The dissolved polymer matrix was then removed using n-hexane and 44% H2SO4-impregnated silica gel before analysis of the extract. A run time of less than 10 min was achieved using a custom, short GC column (5 m). The detection limits of the method were below the upper threshold of the low POP content limits defined by the Basel Convention (<1000 mg kg−1 for both PBDEs and HBCD). The accuracy of the method was confirmed by analyzing seven polymer reference materials. The determined PBDE and HBCD concentrations in most of these reference materials were within 30% of the certified values; the coefficients of variation in triplicate analysis were also within 30%. The concentrations of PBDEs and HBCD in actual plastic waste measured by this method were comparable with those obtained by more sophisticated and expensive methods, such as GC–high-resolution MS for PBDEs and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for HBCD. Hence, the method developed herein is a less expensive alternative for identifying PBDE- and HBCD-containing wastes.',\n",

However, microwave pyrolysis of organic wastes for aviation oil production still faces some challenges, and intensification issues are raised. This article therefore gives perspectives into intensification of aviation oil production from organic wastes through using microwave pyrolysis. Three main problems are summarized for microwave pyrolysis of organic wastes for aviation oil production: (a) poor heating, (b) microwave loss, and (c) low oil quality. Then, four issues are targeted for the full intensification of microwave pyrolysis of organic wastes for aviation oil production: (a) feedstock screen, (b) heating process intensification, (c) pyrolysis process intensification, and (d) products intensification. If appropriate feedstock, microwave absorbent, pyrolysis temperature, microwave power and reaction catalyst are well screened and controlled, more than 98.78 wt.% oil yield can be achieved and the produced oil components are very similar to conventional aviation oil components. The contents presented in this study can help a better understanding of aviation oil production from microwave pyrolysis of organic wastes.',\n",

High conversion of 1-hexadecene (96%) and n-hexadecane (92%)—surrogates of long-chain molecules—demonstrates the high reactivity of WOx/SiO2 metathesis catalyst for olefin and alkane metathesis reactions, respectively, at moderate reaction temperatures of 300 °C for 2–3 h. Pretreatment temperature and length of the short n-alkane-chain solvent significantly affect the metathesis reactivity and selectivity. Results for the deconstruction of low-density PE (LDPE) in n-decane demonstrate a remarkable potential for PE upgrading with the advantages of short reaction times (3 h), the low mass ratio of solvent to LDPE, and the production of solid products with narrow molecular weight distributions.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Recently, nano-silica (NS) particles with their tailorable property had gained widespread attention due to their broad and emerging application areas, which included adsorption, biomedical, polymer filler, catalyst, and optical devices. Generally, NS particles were commercially prepared from expensive raw (alkoxysilane compounds) materials with complicated processes, which inspired researchers to seek alternatives. Meanwhile, the fast-economic growth had led to the generation of enormous wastes from the agricultural, industrial, municipality, and mining fields. In the past decade, significant progresses had been made on utilizing the waste ingredients with novel processing methodologies to synthesize the NS, resulted in better purity, porosity, control shape, size, and significant improvements in the extraction yields. This study presents a review of the recent advancements in NS's and silica aerogel synthesis using agricultural, industrial, municipality, and mining wastes. It is also focused on appliance technologies along with their process-dependent properties and suitable applications. This work will draw the attention of research and industries to the potential of silica-containing wastes as sustainable resources for NS's preparation. The future research directions and the challenges for the commercial application of NS are also presented. The waste to NS conversion is expected to solve the disposal problems and conserve natural resources.\",\n",

A core-shell recycled plastic aggregate (RPA) consisting of grinded WEEEP (core) and a mixture of cement and several additives such as a very fine aggregate, clay or activated charcoal (shell) was obtained. We proved that the core-shell strategy, in which cement-activated charcoal shell was employed, produces a stabilization of the hazardous compounds.

In this regard, innovative solutions have been advanced for the reuse of solid waste in non-traditional sectors, including in road asphalt production. The present study investigates the potential production of sustainable superior-performing asphalt mastics (neat bitumen and filler), in which the filler is obtained through procedures of reusing shredded waste plastic (WP) and jet grouting waste (JGW) recovered from soil consolidation activities, rather than traditional limestone filler. A first phase of the study involved the production and the comparison of three asphalt mastics: a mastic containing JGW (JGWM) with a filler over bitumen ratio (f/b) of 0.29, a limestone mastic (LM) blended with an f/b ratio of 0.30 and a mastic containing WP (WPM) made up with an f/b ratio of 0.10. The mechanical characterization was carried out by use of a dynamic shear rheometer for analysis of the rheological performance of the three mastics in terms of rigidity, elasticity and resistance to permanent deformation. A life cycle assessment was conducted using the eighteen impact category indicators of the ReCiPe method, as a means of determining the human and environmental benefits of the innovative hot asphalt mastics. The main results from the mechanical point of view were that, compared to traditional LM: a) at temperatures from 0 to 30 °C, the use of JGW achieved an average 30% greater stiffness; b) at 40 and 50 °C, the WPM reduced permanent deformation by 56%. The most significant outcomes of the environmental analysis were: a) the use of JGWM achieved lower terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication, respectively 53% and up to 97% less than with LM; b) the WPM achieved 33% and 38% reductions in effects on global warming and fossil resource scarcity, respectively.',\n",

The extent of sulphur removal increases in the sequence of Fe/SiO2–Al2O3<Fe/Al2O3<Fe/SiO2 and this might be due to the presence of smaller crystalline size (7.4 nm) of Fe2O3 in Fe/SiO2 catalyst.

Usage of these sustainable recycled products in the civil construction industry will reduce the demand for quarry materials, costs associated with landfilling as well as reducing the carbon footprint of future infrastructure projects. This study is focused on the usage of recovered plastic (RP) blends with demolition aggregates, namely recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) and crushed brick (CB) as railway capping materials. RP used in this research is the mixture of various types of waste plastics, which neither can be separated nor recycled into new products. The influence of RP inclusion in RCA and CB was evaluated based on tests that incorporated the evaluation of particle breakage, compressibility behavior, stiffness and strength parameters of the blends. Resilient modulus, (Mr ) of the recycled products was determined based on a proposed Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) testing protocol, based on the range of relevant applied stresses to capping materials. Two types of conventional capping materials (CCMs) currently used as railway capping materials were also evaluated under similar testing conditions. The responses of the blends were evaluated against the range of results of CCMs to determine the optimum percentage of RP. It was determined that the inclusion of waste plastic in demolition aggregates could enhance the degradation resistance and energy absorption characteristics of blends. Inclusion of RP with 5% in RCA and 3% in CB was found to be the optimum blend, which furthermore was found to enhance the energy-absorbing capacity of this alternative recycled railway capping layer product.',\n",

The obtained adsorbent represents highly water-dispersible oligo(terephthalamide) particles of several tens μm size embedding magnetic nanoparticles randomly distributed in the organic matrix. The PET-derived magnetic adsorbent was used for the rapid and facile magnetic separation of an anionic dye (Congo Red, CR) from dye simulated water samples. The adsorbent containing plenty of amine groups showed superb adsorption capacity for CR of ca. 780 mg/g which is pH dependent and optimal at pH 6.5. Furthermore, the microparticular, non-aggregative state of the adsorbent coupled with its magnetic functionality provided rapid saturation of the adsorbent with dye by ca. 70% of the equilibrium adsorption capacity within 5 min and possibility of instantaneous removal from solution by a magnet.

       " {'context': 'In this study, the leaching of six phthalic acid esters (PAEs) from three common consumer plastics was investigated: low and high density polyethylene (LDPE, HDPE) and recycled polyethylene (RP). The effects of salinity, temperature, and ultraviolet irradiation (UVR) on leaching were investigated. The study of leaching of phthalates in aqueous environments in batch experiments is challenging due to their readsorption by the high hydrophobicity of PAEs, and there are no standard methods to study release processes. Here with the experiments, leaching (A) and spiking (B) using six PAEs to study the readsorption in the leaching process. PAEs were identified and quantified using GC–MS. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and benzyl butyl phthalate (DEHP) showed considerable leaching during the 5-day incubation: 14\\u202f±\\u202f1 to 128\\u202f±\\u202f14 and 25\\u202f±\\u202f2 to 79\\u202f±\\u202f5\\u202fng/cm2, respectively, under UVR, corresponding approximately to (1.9–13%) and (12.4–22.4%) of the solvent extracted mass. The highest Kd values were measured for RP polymers (0.3–9.4), followed by LDPE (0.5–5.4) and HDPE (0.2–2.2) polymers. Thus, readsorption of PAEs at the surface removed 30–80% of the leached PAEs in the dissolved phase. For example in LDPE, the calculated total release of DBP was up to 54\\u202f±\\u202f4\\u202fng/cm2, while the dissolved amount was 8.5\\u202f±\\u202f1\\u202fng/cm2 during the 5-day incubation under freshwater conditions. Increasing salinity negatively affected the leaching rate, which decreased for DBP from 54\\u202f±\\u202f4\\u202fng/cm2 in freshwater to 44\\u202f±\\u202f3 and 38\\u202f±\\u202f3\\u202fng/cm2 at salinity of 20 and 40\\u202fg/L, respectively, from LDPE during the 5-day incubation. Temperature and UVR had a positive effect on the leaching rate, with the release of DBP from LDPE increasing from 44\\u202f±\\u202f3\\u202fng/cm2 at room temperature (25\\u202f°C) to 60\\u202f±\\u202f6 and 128\\u202f±\\u202f14\\u202fng/cm2 at high temperature (40\\u202f°C) and UVR, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the positive relationship between temperatures, UVR on the extent of leaching and surface adsorption on the leaching measurements.',\n",

After successfully clearing most hurdles in the PET bottle sector to promote a successful market launch of the recycled PET products, it is now important to take measures to meet the challenges associated with the recycling of polyolefins such as HDPE. In this respect, the need to further improve recycling technologies is currently prevalent because the quality parameters of the recycled materials do not yet meet the strict industrial requirements. In this context, apart from optical or mechanical properties, there is increasing awareness of odorous contaminants in the recycled products. Therefore, in this study, a modified HDPE recycling method was evaluated for its ability to reduce odors. For the aim of mapping and understanding the odor of recycled HDPE pellets with different residence times in a special decontamination reactor a combinatory sensory and instrumental-olfactometric approach was applied. Furthermore, based on the characterization of the causative odorants by gas chromatography-olfactometry and two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry, quantitative determination of selected odorants was carried out over time using stable isotope dilution analysis. With regard to the decontamination efficacy of the evaluated decontamination process, we observed that the decrease in the concentration profiles of the monitored odorants went along with a sensorially relevant overall odor minimization of the recycled HDPE. The results of the study are aiding the adaptation of technological procedures for smell reduction or complete decontamination.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A large amount of yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) waste is produced during the manufacture of dental prostheses by the CAD/CAM milling process. This work investigated the recycling and processing of zirconia waste powder (ZWP), generated from the manufacture of dental prostheses (CAD/CAM milling process). The physical and mechanical characteristics of the bodies produced with ZWP were evaluated. The received ZWP was calcined at 500 °C and de-agglomerated with a roll jar mill under different experimental conditions. The grinding condition with a relation between grinding medium mass (GM) and ZWP mass of 13 and a milling time of 90 min presented the best results. This procedure produced ZWP with the smallest mean particle size (0.4 μm) and the lowest tetragonal-monoclinic transformation (16.9%). The water absorption, apparent porosity, bulk density, and mechanical properties were evaluated from ZWP non-deagglomerated and ZWP de-agglomerated after sintering at 1300 °C, 1400 °C, and 1500 °C. ZWP de-agglomerated samples reached bulk density, microhardness, and flexural strength values of 5.8 ± 0.1 g/cm3, 1523 ± 173 HV, and 342.8 ± 66.7 MPa, respectively. The achieved values of bulk density and microhardness were similar to those of commercial ZrO2 bodies processed under the same conditions, 6.0 ± 0.1 g/cm3 and 1412 ± 70 HV, respectively. But flexural strength of ZWP bodies was lower than that of commercial ZrO2, 680.5 ± 96.0 MPa. However, the achieved strength is higher than that observed for porcelain and glass-ceramic dental materials used for single-unit anterior or posterior prostheses (<200 MPa), which depicts the ZWP potential as an alternative low-cost and high-strength material in ceramic prostheses.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This investigation reports the photocatalytic performance of the tungsten doped titania (TiO2:W or TW) with and without coating of chlorophyll (Chl) for the removal of the RhB dye from the drinking water. These particles were also supported on recycled plastic bottle caps (Bcap) to form other photocatalytic composites (TW/Bcap and TW + Chl/Bcap). The SEM images demonstrated that the TW particles without Chl had irregular shapes and sizes of 0.8–12 μm. The TW particles coated by the Chl presented shapes of quasi-rounded grains and smaller particle sizes of 0.8–1.8 μm. The photocatalytyic experiments showed that the photocatalyst powders containing Chl removed completely the RhB dye from the water after 2h under UV-VIS light, while the photocatalyst without Chl removed a maximum of 95% of the RhB. Interestingly, the TW/Bcap and TW + Chl/Bcap composites removed 94–100% of the RhB after 2h. Those ones removed such dye by photocatalysis and by physical adsorption at the same time (as confirmed by the absorbance and FTIR measurements), therefore, the removal of RhB was still very high. Scavenger experiments were also achieved and found that the •OH radicals are the main oxidizing species generated by the photocatalysts with and without Chl. The •O2 − radicals and holes (h+) were the secondary oxidizing species. The presence of the chlorophyll on the photocatalyst increased in general the light absorption and the photocurrent. Overall, our work demonstrated that making composites with recycled plastic bottle caps is a feasible alternative to remove dyes from contaminated drinking water with high efficiency and low cost.',\n",

However, the tackling of these recalcitrant plastic-based products wastes is becoming the most challenging part around the world contributing severe environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emission. Currently, the paradigm shifts from the use of conventional oil-based plastics to biobased plastics from renewable sources as a solution to environmental pollution and reduces carbon footprint. Biobased materials provide as a green alternative through the recycling of plastic wastes along with biogenic capitals that are available within our ecosystems across the globe. In this chapter, the biodegradation propensities, biodegradation technologies, and mechanisms of bioplastics and biocomposites were highlighted. Diverse certification systems to ensure environmental safety and sustainability of bioplastic and biocomposites in our environment were also presented.

While MPs are spreading throughout several complex environmental matrices, various experiments till date have been preliminary concentrate on aquatic ecosystems. Terrestrial sources namely solid waste-origin have remains unexplored, although they contribute largely for aquatic microplastics origin. Simultaneously, terrestrial systems under human activity, like healthcare units, are likely to be polluted by various plastic ingredients. Solid waste MPs sources primarily include sanitary landfilling, food waste, wastewater treatment end-product (sludge), tire wear, textile washing and paint failure. These microplastics caused adverse impacts on ecosystem, environment, and health. Accordingly, the present study addressed solid waste MPs’ occurrence and sources, identification, quantification, characterization, fate, and degradation pathways for developing comprehensive management strategies following the principles of circular economy. In particularly, this paper critically demonstrated solid waste MPs sources, solid waste MPs sampling followed by identification and quantification by adopting combined chemical (e.g., spectroscopy viz., Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy), physical (e.g., microscopy such as transmission or scanning electronic microscopy, TEM or SEM) and thermal analyses. Additionally, the strengths and limitations of each analytical technique are discussed critically with practical aspect. Further, the MPs related national and international regulations or laws and their subsequent relevance to solid waste MPs management with future challenges are discussed very critically.

       " {'context': 'Primitive electronic waste (e-waste) dismantling activities have been shown to be an important emissions source for a variety of toxic organic compounds, including carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Previous studies have found that some nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) are more toxic than their parent PAHs, however, little attention has been paid to the formation of PAH derivatives during e-waste processing and there is a lack of comprehensive data from field observations. In this study, the spatial distribution, temporal trends and atmospheric fate of NPAHs and hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) were investigated at typical e-waste dismantling sites, with monitoring data collected over three consecutive years. Compared to background levels, higher levels of NPAHs and OH-PAHs were found in air samples from an e-waste dismantling industrial park, with their seasonal and annual changes shown to be affected by e-waste dismantling activities. Atmospheric PM2.5 particles were found to have high relative abundances of NPAHs (76.9%–95.1%) and OH-PAHs (73.3%–91.6%), with particle-bound concentrations ranging from 20.1 to 88.8 and 37.1 to 107 pg m−3, respectively. The most abundant NPAH isomers were found to be 9-Nitroanthracene and 2-Nitrofluoranthene, while OH-PAH isomers containing 2–4 rings were predominant. Source identification was performed based on the specific diagnostic ratios of NPAH isomers, confirming that NPAH and OH-PAH emissions have multiple sources, including emissions related to the e-waste dismantling process, atmospheric photochemical reactions and traffic emissions. Further research on the fate of such derivatives and their potential use as markers for source identification, is urgently required.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recycling of plastic waste (PW) is one alternate approach to reduce the adverse impact on environment despite many control measures adopted around the world. Current study introduces various types of PW as a binding material to completely substitute cement to produce cement-less paver blocks. The constituent of paver block comprises of mixture of different types of PW in different proportion mixed with natural fine aggregate. PW in varying proportions of 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% were used to replace cement and investigated to ascertain achieving satisfactory physical and mechanical properties considering temperature effects. The compressive strength increases with increase in the proportion of plastic content. However, when exposed to very high temperature, its strength is reduced by 31.17%. According to the test results, the plastic paver block has a low water absorption potential. The average initial and final setting time of the binder was 19 and 24 minutes respectively. Abrasion test indicated low surface wear, displaying high durability with maximum of 2.56% wear. A trial foot path pavement was constructed using cement-less paver blocks and evaluation of its performance are discussed. The production of one cement-less paver block utilizes 1.8 kg PW. As per the economic assessment, an average unit cost of cement-less block is evaluated to be 35.39% less than concrete paver block. The findings indicate cost benefit of 29.39 to 32.15% when PW is utilised in construction. To evaluate the sustainability, an “Environmental Suitability Index” (ESI) is developed based on three parameters: embodied energy, life-cycle costs (LCC) and re-usability based on literature review. Three additional parameters: fire resistance, social impact and labour efficiency are introduced to further enhance the ESI in the current study.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A validated solid-phase extraction procedure was developed in order to efficiently recover active pharmaceutical ingredients from room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) followed by waste processing with the final objective of IL recycling. Three different imidazolium triflimide RTILs were independently applied as sample matrices. Analytes included cannabidiol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, estrone and estradiol. Nine commercially available solid sorbents were tested for their analyte recovery and IL separation performance, with three sorbents being selected and applied for further detailed extraction experiments. Final results showed high recoveries for the extraction of cannabidiol (97.8%), analgesics (86.6–92.1%) and hormones (94.5–95.7%) with relative standard deviations between 0.6 and 2.2%. After analyte extraction, 93.3 to 96.5% of RTIL could be recycled, hereby exhibiting no significant evidence of residual contaminations. Preliminary tests on industrial hemp plants showed that the developed method can also be applied to real-world samples. Conclusively, this study not only presents the efficient recovery of analytes from imidazolium triflimide RTILs to achieve compatibility with certain analytical detection methods, but also creates the opportunity to sustainably utilize ILs in analytical sample preparation.',\n",

Subsequently, the flowability, compressive and flexural strengths, and impact resistance of the RFRRC are discussed. Experimental results show that the compressive strength of the mixed composites is slightly improved, while the ductility, flexural toughness, impact resistance and energy absorption capacity are significantly enhanced. Ecological evaluation of the RFRRC is conducted through case studies of an individual building and regional buildings. Evaluation results indicates that CO2 emissions can be substantially reduced through the application of RFRRC in construction fields. The application of RFRRC not only can improve the mechanical properties of concrete, but also is of great benefit to ecological environment.',\n",

However, different MCSWs may result in metal-containing solid waste/biochar composites (MCSW-BCs) with various physicochemical properties and adsorption performance, causing distinct adsorption mechanisms and applications.

To get deeper insights into its causes, this study aimed at characterizing the odor of post-consumer and recycled automotive polypropylene with different contents of talc and an anti-fogging additive. Samples were evaluated by different sensory methods currently applied by the automotive industry (GMW 3205 and VDA 270), which confirmed, that they are not feasible for reuse in interior automotive applications. As these odor evaluations are usually performed by non-trained panelists and do not allow a detailed description of the samples’ single odor qualities, sensory evaluation according to ISO 13299 was performed by trained panelists. Samples showed medium–high odor intensities rated from 5.1 to 5.6, and a general dislike of the odor with hedonic ratings from 1.8 to 2.6 (scale 0–10). Their odor profiles correlated well with the odorants identified by chemo-analytical characterization using gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC-O) and two-dimensional GC-O coupled with mass spectrometry (2D-GC–MS/O). An array of odorants with benzene and phenolic structures were identified as potential contributors to the samples’ overall smell and are likely to originate from degradation of additives commonly used in automotive components. While the addition of talc or anti-fogging additive did not significantly improve the odor of the samples, the description of the samples’ smell and the identification of odor-active compounds related to it allow the development of avoidance strategies for the manufacturing of neutral smelling products intended for vehicles’ interior applications.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Life cycle assessment (LCA) is gaining importance worldwide in guiding waste management policies. The capacity of co-products such as recycled materials and recovered energy to avoid primary production of equivalent products largely determines the environmental performance of waste treatment technologies. Estimating the reductions in resource use, emissions, and impacts enabled by this substitution of primary production is often the most influential and controversial factor in quantifying the overall environmental performance of a waste management strategy. This study aims to critically evaluate the modelling of substitution in LCAs of recovered material from municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS) by answering two questions. First, to what extent is substitution modelling transparently documented in the literature? Second, are the substitution ratios justified to represent physically realistic replacement of one product by another? To address these questions, we performed a systematic analysis of 51 LCA studies on MSWMS published in the peer-reviewed literature. We found that 22% of the substitution ratios are only implicitly expressed. A significant proportion of substitution ratios is not justified (65%), while for the remaining 35%, justifications do not represent physically realistic substitutions. We call for more rigor and transparency, and we propose guidance for the documentation of substitution ratios, with the aim of reaching more credible and robust analyses. For the justification of a substitution ratio to be considered physically realistic, information should notably be provided concerning loss of quality, the function performed by substitutable materials, and the sector of use.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Ionomer and low density polyethylene (LDPE) based composites were prepared containing 40% w/w glass fibers in a random in-plane orientation. These composites were then dissolved, and consequently the polymer/fibers solution was separated by filtration to recover the reinforcing agent and the polymer matrix. Different amounts of hot solvent were employed for washing during filtration to vary the polymer content remaining on the fibers. The recycled fibers were used to prepare ‘new’ composites, i.e., they were incorporated in the same polymer matrix, but of virgin quality. This paper investigates the effect of such an interphase alteration on the tensile performance of these materials. A significant improvement of the tensile modulus was found, namely after one washing of the fibers for the ionomer based composites and two washings for the LDPE based ones. This behavior is discussed in terms of degree of fiber dispersion.',\n",

Inductively heated fast pyrolysis with heating rate of 250 °C min−1 was applied for conversion of three industrial waste streams from a fibre recycling mill, contaminated with plastic wastes, into energy products. Experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (350, 450 and 550 °C) and the yields and energy contents of the char, oil, wax and gas products were determined. For all three waste streams, conversion at 350 °C, mostly concentrated the energy in the char, resulting in calorific values between 20.9 MJ kg−1 and 35.1 MJ kg−1 which are comparable to common bituminous coal used for power generation. Pyrolysis at 450 or 550 °C promoted the formation of condensable volatiles (wax/liquid) with total wax yields of up to 54 wt.% being obtained at 550 °C, with the calorific value up to 41.7 MJ kg−1 comparable to heavy fuel oil. The estimated net energy yield for the three waste streams ranged from 10 to 25 MJ (kg dry feedstock)−1 with the largest energy yield being obtained for the stream containing the largest fraction of hydrocarbon plastics.',\n",

In this work, Si was successfully recovered from Si sawing waste by using a CaO–51mol%SiO2–15mol%MgO slag. This recovery included measurement of the contact angle between a CaO–SiO2–MgO slag and SiC using the sessile drop method. The results, θ SiC/SiO2–CaO–MgO < θ SiC/Si (i.e., 21.7° < 38°) at 1753 K, confirmed the feasibility of applying the slag refining technique to SiC particle removal. Furthermore, with the help of high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscopy, the movement and dissolution behaviors of SiC were observed in situ and in real-time. A prolonged slag refining time provided sufficient time for SiC particle transfer across the Si/slag interface and dissolution in slag, thereby resulting in a high SiC particle-removal efficiency.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from municipal solid waste and the associated climate change impacts are getting attention worldwide. This study aims to advise local governments about the danger of greenhouse gas emissions of waste management technologies. Three waste management scenarios were proposed and assessed based on greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery for the city of Kocaeli, Turkey, for the reference years 2018–2028. The first scenario entailed recycling a fraction of materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals and disposing of the remaining waste in a landfill with landfill gas recovery (current practice), while the second scenario included recycling of all the recyclable materials and producing compost from the remaining organic waste. The third scenario included incinerating all the waste to recover energy. The analysis indicated that, scenarios 1, 2 and 3 saved total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of 275,449 tCO2 e y−1, 287,868 tCO2 e y−1, and 652,626 tCO2 e y−1, respectively. Global warming factors (GWF) for scenarios 1, 2 and 3 were calculated as −1.760, −0.972, −0.940 tCO2 e t−1 waste, respectively. As a separate process, the materials recovery facility in scenario 1 had the lowest GWF (−1.486 tCO2 e t−1), whereas the highest GWF was from composting in scenario 2 (0.106 tCO2 e t−1). Also, the incineration plant would generate on average about 2.09 E+10 kWh y−1 energy, which could reduce coal use by 2.58 E+06 ton per year and natural gas use by 2.37 E+09 m3 per year. The analysis showed that thermal conversion and material recycling are the best options to reduce climate change impacts in the study area. This study will help the local authorities to consider greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery potentials in the study region, as well as in other parts of Turkey, when long term waste management plans are considered.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Not only has the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis, but it has also changed the dynamics of waste generation around the world. This situation demands a productive solution for face mask (FM) waste management to solve several associated environmental issues. In the current study, a novel soil treatment method is proposed for the improvement of mechanical characteristics of fat clay by using FM as fiber reinforcement and silica fume (SF) as the cementitious agent in the form of a composite binary admixture (CBA). The performance of the proposed CBA is compared with SF and FM as the lone stabilizers by conducting extensive geotechnical testing. The SF treatment exponentially improves the strength characteristics of soil but it marginalizes the ductility of soil, inviting sudden failure and instability under dynamic loadings. It is observed that the proposed CBA not only improves the strength characteristics more than SF but also regulates the ductility and deformability of treated soil due to the presence of FM fibers. In addition, the policies and protocols on the logistics of collecting FM waste and making it ready for the proposed geotechnical application are reviewed; associated health risks, socioeconomic conditions and available technologies are the major governing factors to formulate and implement these policies. Moreover, the prolonged storage of COVID-19 FM waste for disinfection is found to be suitable for the proposed soil stabilization method as per the literature. The current study helps in achieving cost-effective filler/foundation material, solving COVID-19 FM waste problems and promoting resource conservation.',\n",

To achieve this aim, SD/rEPS composites containing different loading level (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 wt percent) of SD were prepared. The addition of 20% SD exhibited better dispersion within recycled expanded polystyrene (rEPS) matrix than higher loading level of SD, as indicated from scanning electron microscope. Consequently, the tensile strength and flexural strength were improved by 16.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The higher loading level of SD displayed aggregation within rEPS matrix which reflected negatively on the mechanical properties. Young's and shear modulus varied from between 0.41 and 1.23 GPa for 0–60% SD. Longitudinal and bulk modulus recorded a reduction from 0.55 to 1.26 GPa with increasing SD. Sound absorption improved with increasing SD loading level. Nonperforated samples of 60% SD and 80% SD had high absorption at 500 and 315 Hz where the sound absorption coefficient (SAC) was about 0.85 and 0.75, respectively. The perforated sample of 80% SD exhibited the highest sound absorbing at low frequencies 315 Hz (SAC~0.9).

Understanding the environmental tradeoffs of various end-of-life strategies for plastic film waste is thus important for developing and deploying appropriate sustainable solutions. In this paper, we use life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental impacts of various plastic film waste treatment systems. We consider four different waste treatment scenarios for plastic films: landfill disposal of mixed waste; incineration of mixed waste; recycling of mixed waste; and recycling of recyclable waste. The results demonstrate a considerable advantage of recycling over landfill disposal or incineration. The main environmental benefit is from the recycle of plastics that can substitute for the production of plastics from virgin materials. From a sensitivity analysis, five key parameters are identified that affect the aggregate environmental impact including mass fraction of films in the waste, recycling rate, utilization rate, waste-to-energy conversion rate, and the type of energy can be substituted by the recovered energy from incineration.',\n",

       " {'context': 'At elevated temperatures, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is known to undergo a cascade of interconnected chemical reactions, in particular oxidative crosslinking, which can lead to severe limitations in processability, product properties, and recyclability. To control such undesired reactions, a newly synthesized phosphorus-based additive with promising flame retardant properties (T. Stelzig et al. Dopo-Based Hybrid Flame Retardants. EP2921498 (A1), 2015), by the chemical name 6-((1-oxido-2,6,7-trioxa-1-phosphabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-4-yl)methoxy)dibenzo[c,e][1,2]oxaphosphinine 6-oxide (DOPO-PEPA, or simply DP), was added to PET in different concentrations. To assess the miscibility of DP and PET at the nanoscale, a multiscale simulation scheme was developed by combining molecular dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics. DP showed a prominent inter-chain lubrication effect in PET in extrusion experiments. To replicate the heating cycles during repeated recycling, the thermal stability of PET melts was assessed on extended timescales using rheological measurements. Time-resolved frequency sweep experiments were conducted with or without the novel DP additive, under air and nitrogen atmospheres. By combining various chemical analysis techniques, a chemical stabilizing mechanism could be proposed that describes how the DP molecule intervenes with the degenerative chemical reactions of PET chains in the melt processing phase. The proposed mechanism outlines trace-release from DP involving the formation of phosphorus radicals including DOPO•, PEPA•, and PO•. Such radicals scavenge the oxygen radicals from air and can thus protect the linearity of PET chains. The results underline the synergistic effects of DP on the processing of high performance PET. Together with flame retardancy of the original product, the environmental-friendly DP chemically-protects and lubricates PET during subsequent recycling of the waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis is finding increasing application as a tool for the effective management of industrial waste, as it can process a wide variety of heterogeneous feedstock into energy dense products. Inductively heated fast pyrolysis with heating rate of 250 °C min−1 was applied for conversion of three industrial waste streams from a fibre recycling mill, contaminated with plastic wastes, into energy products. Experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (350, 450 and 550 °C) and the yields and energy contents of the char, oil, wax and gas products were determined. For all three waste streams, conversion at 350 °C, mostly concentrated the energy in the char, resulting in calorific values between 20.9 MJ kg−1 and 35.1 MJ kg−1 which are comparable to common bituminous coal used for power generation. Pyrolysis at 450 or 550 °C promoted the formation of condensable volatiles (wax/liquid) with total wax yields of up to 54 wt.% being obtained at 550 °C, with the calorific value up to 41.7 MJ kg−1 comparable to heavy fuel oil. The estimated net energy yield for the three waste streams ranged from 10 to 25 MJ (kg dry feedstock)−1 with the largest energy yield being obtained for the stream containing the largest fraction of hydrocarbon plastics.',\n",

       " {'context': \"These days, pavements are subjected to a wide range of loading conditions that affect the pavement's performance, resulting in a broad range of distresses. Innovating technologies such as the incorporation of waste plastic and waste tire rubber in the design of pavement have not only increased the strength of the road, but they have also increased the life of the roads. This study investigated the composite effects of waste plastic and crumb rubber (CR) as bitumen modifiers in improving the properties of flexible pavement. Various tests were carried out on aggregates, bitumen, and bituminous mixes as part of this investigation. Since Asphalt is visco-elastic in nature, change in the temperature and different loading condition has a substantial outcome on functioning of asphalt. Comparative study of conventional bituminous mix and modified bituminous mixes with replacement of crumb rubber for fine aggregate in varying percentages like 5%, 10% and 15% and raw coarse aggregate is completely replaced with LDPE coated aggregate at standard mixing and compaction temperature. Coarse aggregate is coated with LDPE in varying percentages like 5%, 7% and 10% and the physical properties like crushing, impact and abrasion values of plastic-coated aggregate is compared with the conventional aggregate. Bitumen binder of VG – 30 with aggregate coated with LDPE and CR shows significant enhanced results in stability, flow value, air voids and specific gravity. Various physical tests on bitumen binder such as Penetration, Viscosity, softening point, loss on heating, Ductility and Flash and Fire point test, were conducted. The bituminous mix using CR is as per the procedure of dry mixing. The optimum percentage of binder content was calculated based on the results of all these tests, which had produced acceptable results in all of the tests conducted. That optimum percentage binder was used in the preparation of bituminous mixes in the testing of pavement properties such as Compressive strength, Marshall Stability and indirect tensile strength. According to the test results, bitumen containing 10% replacement of crumb rubber outperforms conventional bitumen in terms of load-bearing capacity, while aggregates containing approximately 10% plastic coating outperform conventional aggregates. When compared to conventional mixes, it is discovered that the strength has been increased by 60%.\",\n",

One of the sustainable waste management approaches is utilising them in developing biocomposites. Biocomposites are eco-friendly materials because of their sustainability and environmental benefits that have comparable performance properties to the synthetic counterparts. Biocomposites can be developed from both renewable and industrial waste, making them both energy efficient and sustainable. Because of their low weight and high strength, biocomposite materials in applications such as automobiles can minimise fuel consumption and conserve energy. Furthermore, biocomposites in energy-based applications could lead to savings in both the economy and energy consumption. Herein, a review of biocomposites made from various wastes and their related key properties (e.g. mechanical and fire) are provided. The article systematically highlights the individual wastes/by-products from agriculture and materials processing industries for composites manufacturing in terms of their waste components (materials), modifications, resultant properties, applications and energy efficiency.

The increasing use of PPEs to preventing the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in several environmental hazards, creating a new environmental barrier for solid waste management and worsened plastic pollution. This study aimed at assessing the occurrence and distribution of face masks in a metropolitan (Adum – Kumasi), municipal (Ejisu), community (Abenase) and an institution (KNUST) in Ghana. The study showed that a total of 535 face masks were numerated along a stretch of 1,720 m with a density ranging from 0.04 m to 0.42 m. A no significant relationship (P = 0.602) was established between the observation distances and the number of waste face masks numerated. The study also showed that for a 1% increase in the number of face masks on working days, there would be a 0.775% increase in non-working days. A review of literature showed that the disposal of used face masks results in the release of micro- and nano-plastics, Pb, Cu, Sb, Zn, Mn, Ti, Fe and Ca into environmental media. Plastic pollution may be a concern to ecosystems due to its persistence in the environment, lack of environmental awareness, sensitization and education, and poor waste management systems. To ensure a sustainable management of waste face masks, significant efforts are needed. These may include proper disposal, redesigning and producing masks from biodegradable materials, incorporating waste face masks into construction materials, and recycling PPE by pyrolyzing are suggested options for the effective management of face masks.',\n",

To achieve this aim, SD/rEPS composites containing different loading level (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 wt percent) of SD were prepared. The addition of 20% SD exhibited better dispersion within recycled expanded polystyrene (rEPS) matrix than higher loading level of SD, as indicated from scanning electron microscope. Consequently, the tensile strength and flexural strength were improved by 16.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The higher loading level of SD displayed aggregation within rEPS matrix which reflected negatively on the mechanical properties. Young's and shear modulus varied from between 0.41 and 1.23 GPa for 0–60% SD. Longitudinal and bulk modulus recorded a reduction from 0.55 to 1.26 GPa with increasing SD. Sound absorption improved with increasing SD loading level. Nonperforated samples of 60% SD and 80% SD had high absorption at 500 and 315 Hz where the sound absorption coefficient (SAC) was about 0.85 and 0.75, respectively. The perforated sample of 80% SD exhibited the highest sound absorbing at low frequencies 315 Hz (SAC~0.9). The biodegradability of the prepared composites was investigated using burial in soil for 90 days where the weight loss increased linearly with increasing SD within the rEPS matrix.\",\n",

The results, θ SiC/SiO2–CaO–MgO < θ SiC/Si (i.e., 21.7° < 38°) at 1753 K, confirmed the feasibility of applying the slag refining technique to SiC particle removal. Furthermore, with the help of high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscopy, the movement and dissolution behaviors of SiC were observed in situ and in real-time.

       " {'context': 'Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from municipal solid waste and the associated climate change impacts are getting attention worldwide. This study aims to advise local governments about the danger of greenhouse gas emissions of waste management technologies. Three waste management scenarios were proposed and assessed based on greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery for the city of Kocaeli, Turkey, for the reference years 2018–2028. The first scenario entailed recycling a fraction of materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals and disposing of the remaining waste in a landfill with landfill gas recovery (current practice), while the second scenario included recycling of all the recyclable materials and producing compost from the remaining organic waste. The third scenario included incinerating all the waste to recover energy. The analysis indicated that, scenarios 1, 2 and 3 saved total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of 275,449 tCO2 e y−1, 287,868 tCO2 e y−1, and 652,626 tCO2 e y−1, respectively. Global warming factors (GWF) for scenarios 1, 2 and 3 were calculated as −1.760, −0.972, −0.940 tCO2 e t−1 waste, respectively. As a separate process, the materials recovery facility in scenario 1 had the lowest GWF (−1.486 tCO2 e t−1), whereas the highest GWF was from composting in scenario 2 (0.106 tCO2 e t−1). Also, the incineration plant would generate on average about 2.09 E+10 kWh y−1 energy, which could reduce coal use by 2.58 E+06 ton per year and natural gas use by 2.37 E+09 m3 per year. The analysis showed that thermal conversion and material recycling are the best options to reduce climate change impacts in the study area. This study will help the local authorities to consider greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery potentials in the study region, as well as in other parts of Turkey, when long term waste management plans are considered.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The present work aims at tertiary recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) wastes to derive raw materials for production of polyurethane–polyisocyanurate foams. The first step involves glycolytic depolymerization of PET in the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG), under the influence of microwave irradiation with an aim to reduce the energy intensiveness of the process. Experimental conditions like PET:DEG ratio and reaction time were optimized to maximize the extent of PET conversion. Multiple extrusion of PET led to reduction in its molecular weight, which increased its reactivity towards glycolysis. The time required for glycolytic depolymerization of PET could be significantly reduced by employing microwave irradiation instead of conventional thermal process. The glycolysate was subsequently reacted with two different diacids: adipic acid (AA) and sebacic acid (SA) to obtain aromatic oligoesters. For the purpose of comparison, analogous aliphatic oligoesters were also prepared by reacting AA and SA with DEG under similar reaction conditions. The oligoesters were subsequently employed as a raw material for the preparation of polyurethane foams by reacting with diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The hydroxyl:isocyanate ratio in the formulation was decreased to introduce isocyanurate linkages, which resulted in the formation of polyisocyanurate foams with high compressive strength. Various characterization techniques were employed to determine the effect of the aromatic phenyl group and chain length of the diacid on the mechanical and structural properties of the resultant foams.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Waste incineration is one of the most common emission sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), causing potential occupational exposure in waste incineration workers. However, relative investigations among waste incineration plant workers are still very limited, particularly in China. Therefore, we collected urine specimens from 77 workers in a waste incineration plant as the exposed group, and 101 residents as the control group in Shenzhen, China. Nine mono-hydroxylated PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured, and their internal relationships were explored. The urinary levels of most OH-PAHs and 8-OHdG in the exposed group exhibited high levels versus another group (p < 0.05). We found negative associations between OH-PAHs and 8-OHdG in the control group (p < 0.05), while most of OH-PAHs were not associated with 8-OHdG in the exposed group, which indicated that the exposure to waste incineration could enlarge the level of individual oxidative stress damage. Nevertheless, PAHs were less likely to trigger obvious health risks in exposed workers through estimation of human intake and exposure risks. This study provides a reference for occupational PAH exposure and strengthen the need of health monitoring among incineration workers.',\n",

The unregulated accumulation and improper recycling can cause grave hazards to human beings and the environment. On the contrary, e-waste can be considered as a secondary source of metals and energy due to its high metal content and polymeric material. Thus, the present study demonstrates technology for the metallic fraction recovery and the production of valuable gases from e-waste. The process involves pyrolysis at a temperature range of 200 °C–600 °C in a fixed bed setup for 10–60 min. Under optimized operating conditions, 35 wt% combustible gases and 60 wt% solid product were obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C in 20 min. The gaseous product consisted of CH4, H2, CO and CO2, having the heating value 28 MJ/kg whereas, the solid product is a mixture of metals and other solid residue material. Treatment of the solid product using an ultrasonication process resulted in around 90 wt% recovery of metallic fraction, thereby leaving behind solid residue. Moreover, the transfer of precious metals (Au, Ag, Pd and Pt) was nearly 100% to the metallic fraction. This process combines mild temperature pyrolysis and ultrasonication process to provide a solution for efficient management of e-waste, metallic fraction recovery and valuable gases production.',\n",

Although the silicon in sawing waste can be easily enriched to around 90\\u202fwt%, it is difficult to further increase the purity. In this study, silicon ingot was successfully recovered from silicon sawing waste by using a CaO–SiO2–Na2O slag refining method. CaO–SiO2 slag was selected to absorb SiC particles from liquid silicon owing to its excellent wettability on SiC. Na2O was used to decrease the slag viscosity and improve the SiC transfer. SiC mass transfer coefficients in molten slag were calculated for different Na2O contents. The effects of operating variables on SiC removal and silicon yield were investigated, including the Na2O content, refining time, and slag/silicon ratio.

       " {'context': 'Energy shortages and rapid increase in its demand are amongst the major problems facing the world today. In response to the rapid depletion of fossils fuels, other alternative energy sources have been explored. One of the methods of generating energy is converting plastics into usable fuel. Two major problems facing the world today prompting to pyrolysis are disposal of plastic waste due to their non -biodegradable nature and depletion of fossil fuels as a result of the continuously rising demand. The feedstock for the pyrolysis plant was selected to be Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) in the form of flakes ranging from 8 – 12 mm and were supplied by PETRECO. The binary dominance matrix was used to examine the optimal heat exchanger. The helical heat exchanger was designed to reduce cost by elimination of a water pump as the heat transfer fluid lost heat to the atmosphere. It was easier to obtain liquid paraffin from the chosen raw materials since it was already in the paraffin chemical structure. In the pyrolysis plant, the temperature in the reactor increased at a maximum rate of 6˚C/min regulated by a temperature controller and each batch took 60 minutes. The percentage weight of paraffin yield was a maximum of 40% weight of the feedstock. Therefore, 1 kg of plastic waste was converted to 286 ml of paraffin fuel. The presence of oxygen in the PET structure enhanced the solid residue of the product. The properties of the solid residue left in the reactor were sufficient to recommend for PET bricks. The solid residue had a maximum compressive strength of 10 N/mm2 which was within the standard range and had less water absorbing tendencies and hence a longer lifespan. Catalytic pyrolysis can also be explored for future research in order to improve product quality.',\n",

In this study, lead oxide (PbO) and PbO-carbon composite were prepared using waste lead acid battery and waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. Leaching process was adopted for preparation of PbO nanoparticle from waste lead acid battery electrode. Initially, waste lead acid battery paste was converted to lead citrate and was calcined at 400 ℃ for 60 min to convert PbO nanoparticle. The band gap of PbO nano is found to be 4.17 eV using Tauc plot from UV–vis spectroscopic data. The XRD data shows a massicot phase of PbO nanoparticle of size 62 nm. PbO-Carbon composite was prepared using pyrolysis technique at 600 °C taking 1:2 ratio of waste HDPE plastic and PbO NP. The band gap of prepared PbO-Carbon composite is found to be 4.0 eV. The Pt electrode was modified by PbO-carbon composite by casting and drying method using PVDF as a binder to electrode. The capacitance, energy density of the PbO-C nanocomposite modified electrode are found to be 115.33 F/g and 70.63 Wh/kg for scan rate of 0.1 V/s, respectively.

The results showed that CA treatment significantly improved the chloride diffusion resistance of RAC due to the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) formed by the reaction between CA treatment and calcium-rich hydrates.

This research investigates the different catalytic pyrolysis temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) that could improve the hydrogen production and CNTs yield formed on the catalyst. The results reveal that the catalyst composition and pyrolytic temperature significantly affected the development of CNTs and hydrogen production. The Ni/MgAl2O4 produced the highest hydrogen (73 vol.%) and CNTs yield (374 mg g − 1 plastic) among the monometallic catalysts. Adding Ni to the Mg-based catalyst increased metal particle dispersion and metal-support interactions, resulting in better catalytic activity in proportion to filamentous carbon production. Increasing the Mg-Al Mg–Al concentration could promote CNTs graphitization. Therefore, the 1:2 ratio of Ni: Mg catalysts exhibited the most significant catalytic activity in the quantity and quality of generated CNTs. The formation mechanism of bamboo-like CNTs from pyrolysis and catalytic decomposition of PLA was also discussed.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Modifying bitumen by combining elastomers and plastomers has been reported to result in improved overall performance. However, the assessment of the rheological properties is commonly done in the linear visco-elastic region at low strain levels. In this paper, the rutting and fatigue resistance of modified bitumen was evaluated using multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR) and linear amplitude sweep (LAS) tests. A base bitumen was modified with styrene butadiene styrene (SBS), crumb rubber (CR), ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) and various polyethylene to study the effects of these modifiers on the rheological behaviour of hybrid polymer-modified bitumen (PMB). These effects were measured using the non-recoverable creep compliance (Jnr) and percentage recovery (R%) in MSCR tests and by evaluating the fatigue damage using Viscoelastic Continuum Damage (VECD) analysis in LAS tests. Results showed that combining SBS, recycled polyethylene and sulphur resulted in the highest percentage recovery value, whereas using CR with SBS did not significantly affect the rheological results. Sulphur played an important role as a cross-linking agent. Concerning Jnr, the addition of sulphur help lowers the MSCR characteristic values, hence indicating better rutting performance. From the VECD analysis, the utilization of hybrid polymers improved the fatigue performance when compared with unmodified bitumen. Based on the overall MSCR and LAS results, the utilization of waste polymers such as recycled polyethylene and CR has resulted in highly satisfactory performance for both rutting and fatigue resistance. Hence, the usage of waste polymers can be considered a suitable alternative to replace virgin polymers.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This investigation reports the electrochemical performance of foldable supercapacitors (SCs) fabricated with electrodes composed of recycled soda-labels and graphene. To enhance the electrochemical performance of such devices, ZnO:Ca nanoparticles were added on their electrodes, which are quasi-rounded grains with average size of 93 nm. The SC device made without ZnO:Ca showed a maximum capacitance and energy density of 41.2 F/g and 5.7 Wh/kg, respectively. After adding ZnO:Ca in the SC electrodes, such values are increased up to 487.6 F/g and 67.7 Wh/kg, thus, the capacitance and energy density were enhanced by ≈10.8 times. The devices made with ZnO:Ca had a capacitance retention of 72.6% after 6000 cycles of charge/discharge. The analysis by optical absorbance, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence and XPS spectroscopy demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy defects on the SC electrodes produced the storage of charge by redox reactions. The Nyquist plots showed that the SCs made with ZnO:Ca had 38–68% lower charge transfer and series resistances than the device made without ZnO:Ca. This confirmed that the ZnO:Ca deposited on the SC electrodes improves the charge storage and ion diffusion. Hence, the results of this research revealed that efficient and foldable SCs could be made from recycled plastics (soda labels from plastic bottles) and could be used in wearable applications.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Fast industrialization has increased the demand for heavy metals, on the other hand, high-grade ore natural reserves are belittling. Therefore, alternative sources of heavy metals need to be investigated. Massive amounts of industrial wastes are being generated annually. The majority is sent to landfills or to incinerators, which eventually poses environmental challenges such as ecological contamination and health hazards to living beings. Such industrial wastes contain hazardous elements of various metals (Au, Ag, Ni, Mo, Co, Cu, Zn, and Cr), whose improper disposal leads to adverse effects to human being and the environment. As a result, methods for industrial waste management such as reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling have received much attention due to the fact that they improve cost effectiveness over time and enable the metal recovery businesses to thrive profitably. The present study provides a state of art review on the current technologies existing for the recovery of precious metals from industrial wastes streams to analyse the sustainability. Among the wastes, spent petroleum catalysts, medical waste, electronic scraps, battery wastes, metal finishing industry waste, and fly ash are some of the largest industrially-generated wastes. Various metal recovery processes involve physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics of waste streams and target metals for separation and extraction. The current challenges of pyrometallurgy, modification on the hydrometallurgy, physical and chemical methods and other advanced technologies are presented in this review. The hydrometallurgical method, which involves dissolving and leaching, is a proven and successful process for recovering metals from various raw materials. Several other recovery methods have been proposed and are currently being implemented; the problem is that most of them are only successful in retrieving certain metals based on specific properties of industrial waste. The recovered metal solutions are further concentrated and purified using adsorption, cementation, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration and ion flotation techniques, which can also be applied to other liquid waste streams. The recovery method only makes sense if the recovery cost is much less than the value of the precious metal. The limitations placed on waste disposal and stringent environmental legislation require environmental-friendly metal recovery technologies. This review paper provides critical information that enables researchers to identify a proper method for metal recovery from different industrial wastes, and also it benefits researchers and stakeholders in determining research directions and making waste management-related decisions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Low-temperature property of polyethylene (PE) modified asphalt has long been a controversial issue. In order to better understand the low-temperature anti-cracking properties of PE modified asphalt binder, the low-temperature cracking mechanism of PE modified asphalt binder and existing low-temperature property evaluation methods were reviewed firstly. Meanwhile, the factors that affect the low temperature performance of PE modified asphalt were comprehensively analyzed. On the other hand, the state of art of low-temperature performance and evaluation methods of PE modified asphalt mixture were discussed as well as the factors that affect the low temperature performance of PE modified asphalt mixture. It was found that the PE particles or fiber acted as “bridge” that can block the propagation of cracks, leading to the improvement of low-temperature properties of asphalt binder. Low-temperature properties of PE modified asphalt binder are highly dependent on the properties of base asphalt binder and PE essentially and PE content as well which dominated the interaction between PE and base asphalt binder. Additionally, the PE modified asphalt mixture exhibited better low-temperature properties than base asphalt mixture based on the existing low-temperature properties evaluation methods. However, the low temperature properties of PE modified asphalt binder is worse than those of base asphalt binder. The reason behind this phenomenon is believed to be that the existing evaluation methods of low temperature anti-cracking performance of PE modified asphalt binder is improper. Therefore, it is necessary to explore some more appropriately complete methods to evaluate the low-temperature properties of PE modified asphalt binder for the PE modified asphalt community.',\n",

       " {'context': \"There has been increased demand for durable and sustainable construction materials to improve long-term performance of buildings and infrastructure. Polymer modification is a well-known method for improving the properties of construction materials. However, the effectiveness of polymer modification has been limited by the low compatibility between construction materials and polymers, especially polymers from waste plastics and waste rubbers. This paper reviews state-of-the-art studies on compatibilizing polymers via polymer functionalization specifically for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. This paper further examines the efficacy of functionalization for enhancing the properties of construction materials. There are three conclusions from this review: (1) Functionalization of polymers by adding various functional groups to their surface can improve the compatibility of polymers and construction materials such as bitumen and concrete. (2) The efficacy of functionalization of a polymer is highly dependent on the grafting material, the grafting degree, and the architecture of the polymer's structure after functionalization. (3) The application of properly functionalized polymers in bitumen and concretes improves their mechanical properties. For instance, it was found that proper functionalization of waste plastics and rubbers can facilitate their use leading to a simultaneous solution for enhancing durability and sustainability of the built environment and addressing environmental concerns associated with the accumulation of those wastes in landfills. The study further identifies knowledge gaps pertaining to an in-depth understanding of polymer functionalization specifically tailored to construction materials and the need for associated life-cycle assessments. Addressing these gaps will facilitate the generation of value-added applications for waste polymeric materials to promote resource conservation and sustainability.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes is an alternative solution to produce fuel as well as to reduce environmental problem generated from municipal solid waste (MSW). Polyethylene (PE) and cellulose are the main compositions of waste packaging. To produce fuel from these two feedstocks by pyrolysis, the interaction/synergistic effect between them during pyrolysis should be studied. Due to that the interaction should be more pronounced if the two materials are in close contact, the mixing methods of the feedstocks can affect the product yield. In this work, the effect of mixing PE and cellulose on the volatile products from co-pyrolysis was investigated using Py-GC/MS with pyrolysis temperature of 600°C. The different mixing methods used are: mixing by melting (cellulose powder submerged in PE film) and not mixing. The results showed that when PE and cellulose are not mixed the change in products are not significant, only slight increase in acetic acid is observed. When mixed by melting, more oxygenated compounds were produced e.g. higher acetic acid, aliphatic ketones and some pyrans. However, the increases are small and does not significantly affect the main products which are aliphatic hydrocarbons from PE and levoglucosan from cellulose.',\n",

However, it cannot be decomposed naturally, which causes a global warming crisis. Therefore, in this research, a fuel additive was prepared from thermoplastic polycarbonate via catalytic methanolysis. Furthermore, statistical response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to obtain process optimization under various reaction times, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentrations, and methanol contents. After the reaction, a fuel additive of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was separated by filtration and distillation. The results revealed that the optimum reaction time (40 min), 0.5 g of NaOH, and 30 g of methanol were obtained. Successfully, a 3.5 g DMC yield, which was equivalent to more than 95% DMC yield, was achieved. The characterization of DMC was also analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The functional groups of O–H, C–H, C = O and C-O were sequenced in the form of wave frequencies of 3318.46 cm−1, 2963.33 cm−1, 1726.84 cm−1 and 1274.04 cm−1, respectively.

As a consequence, the need for the effective removal of such dyes has become more crucial than before. Recently, polymeric membranes for dye adsorption are gaining tremendous attention. In this context, we synthesized the polyethylene oxide/polyaniline (PEO/PANI) composite membrane by a very simple and cost effective approach for the first time. The removal of methyl orange (MO) dye onto pure PEO and composite membrane was conducted utilizing batch mode. The results proposed that the uptake efficiency of PEO after hybridization with PANI is more than two times higher than that of the unmodified PEO membrane under the same experimental conditions. The effect of changing the adsorbent dose (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 g/L), pH (3, 5, 6.5, 9, 11), and dye concentration (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mg/L) on the adsorption performance of the composite membrane was studied. The reusability studies proved that within 50 min of adsorption period the PEO/PANI composite membrane can retain 99% removal percentage for 8 cycles. This indicates that the low cost composite membrane has a good recyclability, which represents a crucial feature for the sorption technique to remove dyes from wastewater streams. Additionally, the proposed adsorption mechanism was discussed. Finally, the as-synthesized PEO and PEO/PANI was tested as a pressure filtration membrane using a cross-flow filtration system. The results revealed that the incorporation of PANI improved the dye rejection by 82.5% compared to that of the pure PEO membrane.',\n",

The World Bank estimates that global waste generation is expected to increase 70% by 2050. Disposal of waste is already a major concern as it poses risks to the environment, human health, and economy. To tackle this issue and maximise potential environmental, economic, and social benefits, waste valorisation – a value-adding process for waste materials – has emerged as a sustainable and efficient strategy. The major objective of waste valorisation is to transit to a circular economy and maximally alleviate hazardous impacts of waste. This review conducts bibliometric analysis to construct a co-occurrence network of research themes related to management of five major waste streams (i.e., food, agricultural, textile, plastics, and electronics). Modern valorisation technologies and their efficiencies are highlighted. Moreover, insights into improvement of waste valorisation technologies are presented in terms of sustainable environmental, social, and economic performances. This review summarises highlighting factors that impede widespread adoption of waste valorisation, such as technology lock-in, optimisation for local conditions, unfavourable regulations, and low investments, with the aim of devising solutions that explore practical, feasible, and sustainable means of waste valorisation.',\n",

Results showed the prevalence presence of cellulosic and polyester microfibers (between 84.4 and 100%) of blue and transparent colors (up to 55.6 and 33.3%, respectively), with an average length of 786.9 ± 812.1 μm in the water samples.

       " {'context': 'In this study, using an analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS system, pine sawdust was pyrolyzed with polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the presence of HZSM-5 to investigate the effect of plastic. Pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C after 3.0 mg feedstock loading. Chemical compounds were identified and classified into six groups: Monomeric Aromatic Hydrocarbon (MAH), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH), Phenols, Furfurals, Alkenes, and Alkanes. Results showed that pine and PE co-pyrolysis significantly decreased oxygen content from 23.4% (pine only) to 0.3% (pine + PE/HZSM-5), which increased products’ HHV from 25.9 MJ/kg to 34.4 MJ/kg. It also revealed that the pine and PE ratio did not heavily influence the petrochemical concentration (aromatic hydrocarbons + alkenes (C ≤ 15) + alkanes (C ≤ 13)). However, a higher plastic ratio led to a higher wax production, which is the reason for poor condensation performance in condenser bio-oil capture. A pinewood sawdust to PE ratio of 3:1 showed the most higher-level petrochemicals and least amount of wax formation. Pine and PET co-pyrolysis produced significantly less wax and similar aromatic hydrocarbons to pine and PE co-pyrolysis. It also made as many acids as PET depolymerization and is a problem for pyrolysis oil use.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Biodegradable plastics, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), are considered the alternative for alleviating the environmental issues caused by the accumulation of petroleum-based plastic wastes. However, PLA is relatively expensive, and its natural degradation is slow. Therefore, upcycling instead of disposing of PLA should be more favorable for sustainability. Herein, we studied the selective methanolysis of PLA to produce methyl lactate (ML) catalyzed by a new molecular catalyst, tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF), with superior thermal and chemical stability and excellent catalytic performance. The complete methanolytic depolymerization of the commercial PLA pellets, 4043D, 6060D, 6202D, and 2500HP, was achieved within a short reaction time (<60 mins) under mild conditions (90 °C–110 °C), yielding nearly 100% ML. The reusability of TMAF in the depolymerization of PLA pellets was subsequently investigated. The characterizations by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometry were used to investigate the mechanism of the PLA depolymerization in the methanol solvent. F- was found to be the active center of the TMAF catalyst. A possible random scission depolymerization pathway of the TMAF catalyzed methanolysis of PLA was proposed.',\n",

The chemical, textural and structural properties of SG, AG and NFMAG were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area analysis, energy dispersion X-rays spectroscopy (EDX), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. SG, AG and NFMAG exhibited microporous structures with high surface areas of 391.06, 460.01 and 319.62 m2 g−1 respectively. SG, AG and NFMAG were used in the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from an aqueous solution. The effect of contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial solution pH, initial dye concentration and temperature were studied. The adsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics were investigated. A maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qm) of 216.83, 348.30 and 291.78 mg g−1 were obtained for SG, AG and NFMAG respectively. AG and NFMAG showed superior adsorption capacity over their precursor SG due to the high surface area and surface chemistry. MB adsorption with all prepared adsorbents followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorption mechanisms were explained using FTIR, intraparticle diffusion and liquid-film diffusion. All MB-adsorbent systems were endothermic and spontaneous. The reusability of SG, AG and NFMAG was assessed for five adsorption cycles. NFMAG exhibited excellent stability and reusability due to its ease of magnetic separation.',\n",

The system was run at temperatures between 425 and 475°C and the results compared with those obtained in the absence of catalyst. Temperatures of 450°C and above were required to reach conversion values in excess of 90wt%. At that temperature and in the absence of catalysts, thermal cracking of LDPE generated almost exclusively α-olefins and n-paraffins over a wide range of molecular weights, most of which (74.7wt%) collected as liquid products. Catalytic reforming over n-HZSM-5 was effective at 425°C and caused a significant increase in the proportion of gaseous hydrocarbons (73.5wt% selectivity at 450°C) that consisted primarily of olefins. The remaining liquid products contained a high proportion of valuable aromatic and branched species in the gasoline size range (C5–C12) making it suitable for blending with commercial gasolines. Owing to its weaker acid properties, catalytic reforming over Al-MCM-41 required the use of higher temperatures (450°C and above) to produce a lower proportion of gas products (54–58wt%) but a consequently higher amount of liquid (34–42wt%) hydrocarbons. Besides, formation of aromatics was less significant than with n-HZSM5, but the resulting oils contained a good combination of olefins and iso-paraffins. This product composition is comparable to commercial transportation fuel.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper reviews the new progress, challenges and barriers on production of pyrolysis oil from the plastic waste. Among the different processes thermal and catalytic are the potential methods to produce oil. Since the global plastic production increased over years the accumulation of plastic waste increases. Thus, converting the waste plastics into useful energy is very essential to avoid the environmental concerns. Initially the thermal pyrolysis process and its advantage on production of pyrolysis oil were discussed. During the thermal decomposition the waste plastic had been converted into the products such as gas, crude oil and solid residues. Secondly, the catalytic process and its recent trends were discussed. In addition, the factors affecting the catalytic pyrolysis process had been evaluated. Furthermore, the optimized concentration of catalyst subjected to the higher yield of fuel with low hydrocarbon content was found. The pyrolysis oil produced from the catalytic process has higher heating values, lower density and lower viscosity compared to thermal process. In addition, the application of pyrolysis oil on the diesel engines had been discussed. The effects of pyrolysis oil on combustion and emission characteristics were observed. This review summarizes the potential advantages and barriers of both thermal and catalytic process. Further, the optimized solutions and applications of pyrolysis oil are suggested for sustainability of the process. Besides the introduction of the pyrolysis oil were viable without making major modification to the existing engine design.',\n",

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the polarized light microscopy (PLM) results have clearly shown that raw chrysotile asbestos was converted to non-asbestiform material with no crystallinity by the low temperature thermochemical treatment. As an alternative to the use of pricey sulfuric acid, waste sulfuric acid discharged from a semiconductor manufacturing process was reused for the asbestos-fracturing purpose, and it was found that similar removals could be obtained under the same experimental conditions, promising the practical applicability of thermochemical treatment of ACWs. A thermodynamic understanding based on the extraction rates of magnesium and silica from a chrysotile structure has revealed that the destruction of chrysotile by acid-digestion is greatly influenced by the reaction temperatures, showing a 80.3-fold increase in the reaction rate by raising the temperature by 30–100°C. The overall destruction is dependent upon the breaking-up of the silicon-oxide layer – a rate-limiting step. This study is meaningful in showing that the low temperature thermochemical treatment is feasible as an ACW-treatment method.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A large volume of the waste produced across the world is composed of polymers from plastic wastes such as polyethylene (HDPE or LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) amongst others. For years, environmentalists have been looking for various ways to overcome the problems of such large quantities of plastic wastes being disposed of into landfill sites. On the other hand, the usage of synthetic polymers as oil sorbents in particular, polyolefins, including polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) have been reported. In recent years, the idea of using plastic wastes as the feed for the production of oil sorbents has gained momentum. However, the studies undertaking such feasibility are rather scattered. This review paper is the first of its kind reporting, compiling and reviewing these various processes. The production of an oil sorbent from plastic wastes is being seen to be satisfactorily achievable through a variety of methods Nevertheless, much work needs to be done regarding further investigation of the numerous parameters influencing production yields and sorbent qualities. For example, differences in results are seen due to varying operating conditions, experimental setups, and virgin or waste plastics being used as feeds. The field of producing oil sorbents from plastic wastes is still very open for further research, and seems to be a promising route for both waste reduction, and the synthesis of value-added products such as oil sorbents. In this review, the research related to the production of various oil sorbents based on plastics (plastic waste and virgin polymer) has been discussed. Further oil sorbent efficiency in terms of oil sorption capacity has been described.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Over the past few decades, electrical and electronic equipment has become more accessible to people of different social status. Currently, however, only a small fraction of the resulting waste is treated properly, even though it has the potential to become a major source of raw materials. Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), or e-waste, is mainly composed of plastics and metals that can be recovered with a lower environmental impact and more efficiently in comparison with conventional processes, even when similar technologies are used. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical processing technique that is able to exploit the polymers in WEEE as well as concentrate the metals into a solid residue. Furthermore, this process can be adapted or combined with other technologies to minimize the content of organic halides that stem from the hazardous brominated flame-retardants (BFRs), which are common additives used in these products. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) uses a heating mechanism that differs significantly but has advantages over conventional pyrolysis, such as a rapid volumetric heating or a higher energy efficiency. Despite the increasing interest in the application of MAP over the last years, research to date in this field remains scarce. As such, this article reviews current studies into the treatment of WEEE by MAP, thereby shedding light on the different variables that have an impact on its effectiveness and efficiency, to provide a comprehensive understanding of this technology. In addition, this review offers an overview of the characteristics of pyrolysis products and possible routes for their subsequent refining.',\n",

The samples with 30 wt. % of plasma treated PET exhibited the same internal bonding strength as the control pure wood sample; samples with 15 wt. % of plasma treated PET exhibited the same modulus of rupture.

       " {'context': 'This study elaborates on the effect of addition of waste engine oil on the viscoelastic properties of asphalt blends containing aged binder and virgin binder. Several asphalt blends were prepared using varying percentages of waste engine oil, virgin binder, and aged binder. These blends were tested for its engineering, and viscoelastic properties. It was observed that the addition of waste engine oil decreased the viscosity (at given temperature), and softening point values when compared to control blend (containing virgin and aged binder only). Among all waste engine oil modified blends, addition of waste engine oil resulted in corresponding decrease in complex modulus values at all frequencies. Further, addition of waste engine oil led to increase in phase angle values at any given frequency. Comparison of curves in black space indicated significant changes with short-term aged blends when compared to corresponding unaged blends. Among all blends, at any given time, lower relaxation modulus was obtained with increase in waste engine oil content. However, this decrease was not significant beyond addition of 6% waste engine oil. Broadly it was observed that the addition of 2–4% of waste engine oil negates the effects caused by addition of aged binder. This indicates that waste engine oil can act as a rejuvenator while providing elasticity and flexibility to asphalt binder.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Enormous production, use, and disposal of plastic goods present great challenges to environmental sustainability. Microplastics (MPs) are added into land which may serve as a larger MP repository than the ocean. Organic solid wastes and their biologically treated products can easily enter the soil and accumulate in soil systems. The current work deals with the extraction, identification, and distribution of MPs in typical organic solid wastes (food waste, livestock manure, and sludge) and their biologically treated products. The ecological risks of MPs were also preliminarily evaluated. The results showed that the abundance of MPs in organic solid wastes was in order of sludge > food waste > livestock manure. The main categories of MPs were fibers and films including PE, PP, and PET. The colors of MPs were mainly black, red, blue, and green. MPs generally exhibited bulges, depressions, cracks, or holes after biological treatment, and would be degraded into smaller fragments with potentially greater ecological risks. It was also found that the polymer risk index (H) of MPs in semi-dynamic composting products, compound fertilizer, and biogas residue of sedimentation tank sludge were higher than 10, reflecting their high ecological risk. Thus, it is recommended that the input of (micro)plastics to organic solid wastes streams should be minimized and related management should be established for the utilization of organic solid wastes and their biologically treated products.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of construction and demolition (C&D) wastes in building materials is a key step toward a sustainable construction industry. In this context, the application of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) in cement composite mixtures has been investigated by various researchers. The results available in the literature indicate that cement mortar adhered to the surface of RCAs leads to high water absorption and large porosity in cementitious mixtures. As a result, lower workability, durability, and mechanical properties in comparison to conventional aggregates are often known as the main attributes of mixtures containing RCAs. Additionally, improving the thermal energy storage capability of RCAs by using high-performance thermal insulation materials, such as phase change materials (PCMs) and aerogel can assist in minimizing the energy consumption in buildings. Accordingly, this paper aims at characterizing RCA mixtures with enhanced workability, durability, and thermal properties. The effect of using paraffin coated recycled concrete aggregates (PCRAs) and aerogel aggregates on the mechanical, thermal, and durability properties of cement composites are investigated in this paper. Results of dry density, compressive strength, water absorption content, permeable voids, thermal conductivity, rapid chloride migration test (RCMT), capillary water absorption, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are reported to evaluate the effect of several variables on the investigated concrete mixtures. Results of the conducted tests indicate that using PCRA significantly improves the durability characteristics of mixtures such as water absorption content, permeable voids, and RCMT, while it slightly decreases the compressive strength of mixtures with respect to the control mixture. In addition, aerogel aggregates significantly improve the thermal conductivity of mixtures while reduced the mechanical and durability characteristics.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of plastic materials is forecasted to double by 2030 in Africa. The increase in plastic demand presents an opportunity to develop biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) instead of petroleum-based plastics. However, the high cost of PHA production is closely linked to feedstock price, which will hinder their deployment. On the other hand, the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, with cassava being one of the most important crops. Cassava industries in SSA produce 146 Mtpa cassava, generating an estimated 40 Mtpa waste, of which 55% goes to landfill or is incinerated. The use of cassava waste as a carbon source for PHA production, therefore, represents an opportunity to decrease production costs of bioplastics while contributing to waste management solutions. This review critically analyses the potential for developing cassava waste biorefineries for the production of PHA in SSA, a region where the bioplastics industry is in a nascent stage. We conclude that cassava waste is an adequate resource for the production of bioplastics in the SSA region that can also contribute toward the reduction of GHG emissions whilst decreasing the dependence on fossil fuels. We identify cost reduction potential with PHA-overproducing strains or strains capable of utilizing substrates more efficiently and show the economic attractiveness of using waste biomass resources in a circular economy framing. Finally, we make recommendations on the next steps needed to pave the way for sustainable economic development, job creation and industrial activity in the SSA region using circular economy principles.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The current study focuses on the understanding of leaching kinetics of metal in the LTCC in general and silver leaching in particular along with wet chemical reduction involving silver nanoparticle synthesis. Followed by metal leaching, the silver was selectively precipitated using HCl as AgCl. The precipitated AgCl was dissolved in ammonium hydroxide and reduced to pure silver metal nanopowder (NPs) using hydrazine as a reductant. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) used as a stabilizer and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) used as reducing reagent as well as stabilizing reagent to control size and shape of the Ag NPs. An in-depth investigation indicated a first-order kinetics model fits well with high accuracy among all possible models. Activation energy required for the first order reaction was 21.242 kJ mol−1 for Silver. PVP and PEG 1% each together provide better size control over silver nanoparticle synthesis using 0.4 M hydrazine as reductant, which provides relatively regular morphology in comparison to their individual application. The investigation revealed that the waste LTCC (an industrial e-waste) can be recycled through the reported process even in industrial scale. The novelty of reported recycling process is simplicity, versatile and eco-efficiency through which waste LTCC recycling can address various issues like; (i) industrial waste disposal (ii) synthesis of silver nanoparticles from waste LTCC (iii) circulate metal economy within a closed loop cycle in the industrial economies where resources are scarce, altogether.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Earthen construction materials are often vulnerable to cracking due to excessive drying shrinkage deformations because of the high content of fine particles. Thus, fibrous materials can beneficially be added, not only to reduce such crack formation but also to improve the mechanical performance. In this study, recycled polyethylene fibres (R-PE) obtained from discarded fishing nets are added to adobe bricks in different fractions (1–5% by weight). Besides a chemical and geotechnical characterization of the raw materials used for the adobe production (Fine-grained Greenlandic sediments (GP) and a coarser gravel fraction (KG)), the investigation described in this paper includes the mechanical properties and restrained drying shrinkage deformations in manufactured, laboratory-scale adobe specimens. The crack formation due to restrained shrinkage is analysed using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, which allows detailed, continuous monitoring and quantification of surface deformations. The results show that the evaluated adobe material can provide adequate mechanical properties, which makes the raw materials suitable for adobe brick production. From the mechanical tests, the addition of R-PE fibres resulted in improved flexural toughness, flexural strength and compressive strength. A detailed analysis using the DIC technique revealed that the addition of R-PE fibres significantly and quantitatively reduces the degree of shrinkage cracking.',\n",

From both the reactions, GC-MS analyses identified small organic acids such as, acetic acid and butanoic acid as a major metabolites released from SPE. In the presence of UV radiation, 21 fold and 17 fold higher amounts of acetic acid (4.78 mM) and butanoic acid (0.17 mM) were released from SPE after 6 h of reaction using TiO2-GOx than free GOx, which released 0.22 mM and 0.01 mM of acetic acid and butanoic acid, respectively.

In this study, 10 heavy metals (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni and Pb) in 13 polished rice and relevant hull samples, six relevant paddy soil samples were investigated. The geometric mean concentrations of Cd, Cu and Hg in soil samples were 1.19, 9.98 and 0.32μgg−1, respectively, which were 4.0, 2.0 and 1.1-folds of the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) (0.30, 50.00, 0.30μgg−1, respectively) for Chinese agricultural soils. The analyzed metal concentrations were significantly different between rice and relevant hull except for As, Cd and Hg (p <0.05). All metal concentrations, except for Co, in rice hull were higher than those in polished rice. The geometric mean of Pb in polished rice reached 0.69μgg−1, which was 3.5-folds higher than the MAC (0.20μgg−1) by the safety criteria for milled rice. Cd contents in 31% of the rice samples exceeded the national MAC (0.20μgg−1), and the arithmetic mean also slightly exceeded national MAC. In addition, Cd and Pb contents in local rice were much higher than commercial rice samples examined in this work and previous studies. Comparing the tolerable daily intakes given by FAO/WHO with the mean estimated daily intakes; Pb daily intake through rice consumption in this area was 3.7μgday−1 kg−1 body weight (bw), which already exceeded the FAO tolerable daily intake, and the Cd daily intake (0.7μgday−1 kg−1 bw) through rice had already taken up 70% of the total tolerable daily intake (1μgday−1 kg−1 bw). The daily intake of Hg and As through rice was much lower than the tolerable daily intakes, but bioaccumulation of Hg through the food chain and intake of As from other food stuff should also be of concern.',\n",

LCDs consume 70% of the total indium resources used in the world today. In this study, a novel fusion of leaching and extraction processes was proposed to recycle indium from waste LCDs using the functionalized ionic liquid betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Hbet][Tf2N]). Under the optimum conditions of 10\\u202fmL 50% (v/v) ionic liquid/ascorbic acid, 20\\u202fg/L of solid/liquid ratio, and 90\\u202f°C operation temperature within 24\\u202fh, the indium leaching rate could reach as high as 99.75% and the indium extraction rate could be enriched by 98.63% in the ionic liquid phase after cooling and stratifying. Introducing ascorbic acid into the process in place of deionized water decreased the distribution rate of iron from 59.87% to 8.84% and promoted the separation of indium and iron. Indium in the ionic liquid phase could then be transferred into an indium-rich solution using oxalic acid and retrieve the ionic liquid. The characteristics of the regenerated ionic liquid remained relatively stable for reutilization. Therefore, the proposed fusion of leaching and extraction processes by [Hbet][Tf2N] provides an efficient alternative to recycle indium from waste LCDs.',\n",

Consequently, it is increasingly employed in building material technology. The sound absorption characteristics of sheep wool render it a satisfactory building insulation material with desirable acoustic properties. This study investigates the effect of waste sheep wool fiber (WF) and modified WFs (MWF) on the acoustic and mechanical properties of concrete. Plain concrete and concrete mixtures containing 0.5–2.5% WF and MWF were tested for compressive strength, modulus of elasticity (MOE), ultrasonic pulse velocity, sound absorption, and transmission loss. The addition of WFs to concrete mixtures slightly reduced the compressive strength and MOE values. However, it significantly improved the sound insulation and noise reduction behavior of concrete specimens, with sound absorption coefficients of 0.66 and 0.75 for mixtures containing 2.5% WF and MWF, respectively, at a frequency of 2000 Hz. In general, the addition of WFs to concrete composites improved their overall acoustic qualities. The findings showed that sheep wool waste, as a sound insulation material, has acoustical properties similar to those of polymeric-based fibers, with the added advantages of being environmentally friendly, affordable, biodegradable, and abundant.',\n",

Four percent HDPE, 165°C of mixing temperature and 30 min of mixing time were determined as optimum conditions for Marshall Stability, flow and Marshall Quotient (MQ). MQ increased 50% compared to control mix. It can be said that waste HDPE-modified bituminous binders provide better resistance against permanent deformations due to their high stability and high Marshall Quotient and it contributes to recirculation of plastic wastes as well as to protection of the environment.',\n",

Two separate questionnaires were issued, one questionnaire to PET bottle consumers and one to PET bottle recyclers. In this study, consumers are defined as people that consume PET-bottled beverages in their daily life. Recyclers were defined as those involved in the collection and recycling of PET bottles. These include scavengers, itinerant waste buyers, small community waste-buying depots, medium/large redemption depots, and recycling companies. In total, 580 surveys were completed, including 461 by consumers and 119 by recyclers. The authors found that consumption of PET bottles in Beijing was nearly 100,000 tonnes in 2012. Age, occupation, gender, and education were identified as significant factors linked to PET-bottled beverage consumption, while income was not a significant factor. 90% Of post-consumed PET bottles were collected by informal collectors (i.e., scavengers and itinerant waste buyers). The survey also found that nearly all PET bottles were reprocessed by small factories that were not designed with pollution control equipment, which allows them to offer higher prices for waste recyclable bottles. As Beijing is trying to build a formal recycling collection system for recyclables, subsidies should be given to the formal recycling sector rather than being charged land use fees, and attention should also be given to informal recyclers that make their living from the collection of recyclables. Informal and formal sectors may work together by employing the scavengers and itinerant waste buyers for the formal sectors. In addition to the recycling of PET bottles, concern should also be allocated to reduce consumption, especially among young people, as they, compared to other groups, have a stronger demand for PET-bottled beverages and will be the main body of society.',\n",

The goal of this work was to instantly identify e-waste polymers by laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS). The studied polymers were acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PP), and polyamide (PA). Emission lines were selected for C (247), H (656), N (742 + 744 + 747), and O (777), as well as the molecular band of C2 (516), and the ratios of the emission lines and molecular band were utilized. Classification models, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), were used to rank the polymers. Both constructed models gave satisfactory results for the validation samples, with average accuracies of 98% for KNN and 92% for SIMCA. These results prove the predictive analytical capabilities of the LIBS technique for plastic identification and classification.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study is conducted to look at the modification of mechanical properties of recycled polypropylene (PP) from post-consumer containers with the addition of stabilizers, elastomer (ethylene–octene rubber, EOR) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The mechanical and thermal properties of the blends were evaluated. The results showed limited changes with the addition of elastomer and calcium carbonate on the mechanical properties of the recycled polypropylene. Some differences were observed, but the trends were not reproducible over the different compositions. DSC analysis confirmed the presence of polyethylene (PE) in the recycled polypropylene. The polyethylene impurity and the presence of many different qualities of polypropylene in the recycled material may have prevented any possible improvement in the mechanical properties by the addition of EOR and CaCO3, improvements seen in previous studies on virgin polypropylene. The compatibility of the different homopolymers and copolymers of PP used in consumer packaging is not known, while polyethylene and polypropylene are known not to be miscible with each other. The mixture of qualities and materials may explain such a poor blending. Reusing and upgrading of recycled PP from post-consumer containers would therefore first require a better sorting of the post-consumer waste. The use of an adequate compatibilizer that would allow a uniform and homogeneous blending of the raw material mixture might enhance the mechanical properties.',\n",

Two types of LLDPE, based on basic additives, were used. UV stabilizer and the slip and anti-block were added as basic additives. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of these basic additives and the treated filler on the biodegradation, morphological, and thermal properties of the prepared samples by a soil burial test. The samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Weight loss was calculated to investigate the biodegradation of the sample, and SEM and thermogravimetric analyses were performed to reveal the morphology and thermal properties before and after burial, respectively. Results showed that the presence of the bio-filler accelerated the biodegradation of the composites. The UV stabilizer had a positive impact on biodegradation factors whereas anti-block additives appeared resistant to biodegradable factors. The morphology and thermal stability of all the prepared samples changed after burial due to the effects of biodegradation during the burial.',\n",

However, additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM) also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage, voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands. Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young’s modulus, tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle, extrusion rate, build plate temperature, and build plate material. Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties. Particularly, an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation. For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break. Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved, as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction.',\n",

Composting piles were submitted to hydration and fraction separation (FS) and then, the solid fraction was vermicomposted and the liquid fraction was anaerobically digested. Composting followed by hydration and FS prior to vermicomposting enhanced earthworm adaptation and survival by reducing salt levels (50%), total organic carbon, and total nitrogen which may be limiting to vermicomposting at high concentrations. These strategies providing the production of up to 300 new cocoons and 360 young earthworms more than the control treatment. In addition to providing a favorable environment for earthworm growth, the combination of bioprocesses resulted in a high-quality organic fertilizer free of phytotoxic compounds and with phytostimulant properties (germination index higher than 100%). Energy recovery was greater in the treatment without the precomposting step (T0) (461.8 L CH4 kg−1. Volatile Solidsadded).

       " {'context': 'A field study was established to assess the effects of a sewage sludge (SS), a mixed municipal solid waste compost (MMSWC) and a compost produced from agricultural wastes (AWC), in a Vertisol, using Lolium multiflorum L. The amendments were applied for two consecutive years: 6, 12 and 24t dry matter ha−1 for SS, and the amendment doses for MMSWC and AWC were calculated to deliver the same amount of organic matter (OM) per unit area. The amendments had significant beneficial effects on some soil properties (e.g. soil OM, NKjeldahl, extractable P and K), and on plant productivity parameters (e.g. biomass yield, chlorophyll, foliar area). For instance, soil OM increased from 0.78% to 1.71, 2.48 and 2.51%, after two consecutive years of application of 24t dry matter ha−1 of SS, MMSWC and AWC, respectively, while the plant biomass obtained increased from 7.75tha−1 to 152.41, 78.14 and 29.26tha−1, for the same amendments. On the plant, effects were more pronounced for SS than for both compost applications, a consequence of its higher capacity to provide N to the plant in a readily available form. However, after two years of application, the effects on soil properties were more noticeable for both composts, as their OM is more resistant to mineralization, which endures their beneficial effects on soil. Cadmium, Cr, Ni and Pb pseudo-total concentrations, were not affected significantly by the application of the organic wastes to soil, in all tested doses, neither their extractability by 0.01M CaCl2. On the contrary, Cu and Zn pseudo-total concentrations increased significantly in the second year of the experiment, following the application of the higher rate of MMSWC and AWC, although their extractability remained very low (<0.5% of their pseudo-total fraction). Trace elements concentrations in the aboveground plant material were lower than their maximum tolerable levels for cattle, used as an indicator of risk of their entry into the human food chain. Despite these results, it is interesting to note that the SS promoted a significant increase in the foliar concentrations of Cu, Ni and Zn that did not happen in composts application, which can be explained by the reduction of the soil pH, as a consequence of SS degradation in soil. Concluding, if this type of organic wastes were to be used in a single application, the rate could be as high as 12 or even 24tha−1, however, if they are to be applied in an annual basis, the application rates should be lowered to assure their safe application (e.g. to 6tha−1). Moreover, it is advisable to use more stable and mature organic wastes, which have longer lasting positive effects on soil characteristics.',\n",

In the presented research, Portland cement pastes containing 50% finely ground recycled concrete, blended with lime, fly ash, or blast furnace slag, were studied. SEM-BSE microscopy, EDX analysis, and porosimetry were employed for investigating their microstructure, individual stages of hydration were detected using calorimetry, shrinkage was optically monitored in the early stages of hardening, the evolution of Young’s modulus was assessed using the resonance method, and strength was determined from destructive tests. The study suggests that recycled concrete fines can be incorporated into cementitious composites in large amounts and even improve their properties, especially when blended with fly ash or blast furnace slag. Substitution of Portland cement in the studied pastes by recycled concrete led to a compressive strength deterioration, but also a reduction of shrinkage, and an increase of the tensile strength in bending by up to 26%.',\n",

       " {'context': 'It is well known that Asia generates and receives large quantities of plastic waste. Through a detailed study of plastic waste generation and trade, the management and treatment of plastic waste in Asia were analyzed from the regional perspective. The amounts of plastic waste in municipal solid waste and in industrial solid waste were estimated to be 79 Mt and 42 Mt, respectively, in Asia. The overall treatment and recycling status in Asia are unsatisfactory. Asia imported 74% of the plastic waste in the world in 2016, and China (mainland) imported the most plastic waste until 2017, with 5.8 to 8.3 Mt. In 2017, about half the plastic waste imported by Asia came from other regions, and after subtracting the exported quantity, 98% of the plastic waste was left in Asia for treatment and disposal. The plastic waste imported by Asia declined about 72% in monetary value in 2018. There is still a large gap between the plastic waste quantity imported to Asia and that exported from Asia. China’s ban of plastic waste imports caused import quantities to drop to 52 kt in 2018, simultaneously, exports from the largest exporting countries or regions such as Hong Kong (China), the USA, Japan, and Germany decreased. While Vietnam, Malaysia and some other Asian countries and regions saw significant increases in plastic waste imports from 2016 to 2018. Considering this situation, countries in Asia are starting to strictly limit plastic waste imports from other countries.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Global economic development and continuous rise in the standard of living has led to resource depletion and increased per capita waste generation and, thus waste management issue becomes crucial. Sustainable development and circular economy require prominent technology for reducing the pace of resource depletion while producing alternatives to meet future energy demands. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a potential source of interest for the recovery of either secondary raw material or to produce energy. At present, most of the MSW in waste treatment plants is converted into recyclable fractions called Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) through the process of Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) with the aim of reducing environmental concerns and increasing its value. The focus of this review is to evaluate the importance of a thermo-chemical process for conversion of RDF into fuel and value-added products as well as evaluating applicability of this process in waste management sector and solid waste treatment. However, due to heterogeneous nature of RDF, investigation of co-pyrolysis behavior of RDF components as well as reaction mechanisms in both catalytic and non-catalytic reactions has been conducted. It has been observed that a high H/C, low O/C ratio and lower biomass content in RDF feed produces better quality products and decreases the dioxins emission during pyrolysis. Interactions of free radicals produced from polymer components with biomass greatly affect the product distribution. Chemicals derived out of RDF pyrolysis have been discussed and effect of various catalysts in enhancing oil yield and quality has been summarized. Catalytic pyrolysis with the use of P, Ni, Co, and Mo modified zeolite catalyst improves the quality of oil, and also the activity and catalyst lifetime. Different reactor technologies available for solid waste valorization have also been analyzed.',\n",

The treatment and recycling of PVC waste is still challenging, due to its non-biodegradability, low thermal stability, high Cl content and low product value. In this study, a one-pot method was developed to upcycle PVC into valuable carbon materials, pipeline-quality pyrolysis gas and chlorides. The well-designed process included dechlorination by Cl-fixative (ZnO or KOH), carbonization of dechlorinated polyenes, and modification of carbon materials in sequence. ZnO and KOH converted 84.48% and 94.15% of total Cl into corresponding chlorides, respectively. CH4 and H2 accounted for 81.87–99.34 vol% of pyrolysis gas with higher heat values of 30.11–32.84 MJ m−3, which can be used as substitute natural gas. As high as 83.13% of the C element was converted into carbon materials. The morphology, structure and property of carbon materials can be modified by different Cl-fixatives. Millimeter-scale carbon spheres with mono-dispersity and porous carbon with a high specific surface area of 1922 m2 g−1 were obtained when ZnO and KOH were added, respectively. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of PVC with Cl-fixatives were also deciphered through thermogravimetric analysis and thermodynamic simulation.',\n",

A three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber-based aerogel, which is extremely soft, flexible, fluffy yet structurally durable, was fabricated by electrospinning process using scrap PET bottles as raw materials. Surface modification of the aerogel was performed to enhance its versatility and efficacy. This aerogel is a sustainable material because it can function as an adsorbent with extremely high capability in removing various heavy metals such as Pb(II), Hg(II), and Zn(II) from the contaminated water with adsorption capacity between 94.5 and 98.3% under optimum experimental conditions. This aerogel was also used as a substrate in a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The maximum value of the peak voltage and current were found to be 67.7V and 9.4 µA, respectively. The TENG was able to lit up nearly 36 colorful LEDs instantaneously upon hand pressing, owing to its unique 3D configuration and surface chemistry. Moreover, the TENG displayed outstanding durability and fatigue resistance over time when subjected to several thousands of mechanical loading cycles.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study evaluated the suitability of old corrugated containerboard (OCC) to be upcycled into a high-quality pulp for tissue paper manufacture. The evolution of the physicochemical properties of OCC fibers and their effect on tissue properties were tracked across each stage of two elemental chlorine free (ECF) bleaching sequences. The properties of bleached OCC were compared to those of deinked pulp (DIP), southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK), and refined OCC unbleached. Both sequences reduced the kappa number from 89 to negligible values and increased brightness from 18.9% to ca. 75% ISO, on average 6.2% ISO units below that of DIP. Overall, bleaching significantly increased tensile index and absorbency rate while having adverse effects on bulk and softness and minor impacts on absorption capacity. The change in properties was correlated to the improved fiber bondability and fiber wettability derived from the lignin removal. Compared to DIP, bleached OCC exhibited a higher tensile index, higher freeness, and similar absorption capacity but lower softness. It also showed higher absorption capacity and similar softness than SBSK but lower freeness at a comparable tensile index. The results indicate that upgraded OCC could be used as an alternative fiber to address the forecasted shortage of high-grade recycled papers in recycled tissue grades or replace virgin fibers in producing virgin tissue grades. In addition, it was determined that refined OCC unbleached could also be suitable for use in tissue grades where high brightness is not an essential product feature.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Currently, 1.3 billion tonnes of food are thrown away each year, most of which are incinerated or landfilled causing large environmental, social, and economic issues. Therefore, the utilisation of food waste as biofertilisers, such as composts and digestates, is a solution to reduce the problems created by incineration and landfilling whilst simultaneously amending soils. The improper disposal of food wastes and bulking materials can contribute to high levels of contaminants within the end-product. Moreover, the food waste and bulking materials, themselves, may contain trace amounts of contaminants. These contaminants tend to have long half-lives, are easily mobile within soil and plants, can accumulate within the food supply chain, and have moderate to high levels of toxicity. This review aims to examine the current and emerging contaminants of high concern that impact the quality of food-waste fertilisers. The paper presents the volume of current and emerging contaminants of plastics, other physical (particulate) contaminants, heavy metals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and pathogens within food-waste composts and digestates. Due to the large extent of organic chemical contaminants and the unknown level of toxicity and persistence, the risk assessment of organic chemical contaminants in the food-supply chain remains largely unknown. This study has presented available data from literature of various contaminants found in food waste, and composts and digestates derived from food waste, and evaluated the data with current regulations globally. Overall, to reduce contaminants in composts and digestates, more studies are required on the implementation of proper disposal separation, effective composting and digestion practices, increased screening of physical contaminants, development of compostable plastics, and increased regulatory policies on emerging, problematic contaminants. Moreover, examination of emerging contaminants in food-waste composts and digestates is needed to ensure food security and reduce future human-health risks.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In 2018 and 2019 the City of Boston (Massachusetts, USA) conducted zero waste and carbon neutral planning efforts. Here we present the results of an accompanying analysis of the impacts of zero waste strategies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions associated with waste treatment. Emissions analysis in the waste sector is complicated by the contribution of significant indirect impacts that can exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity. For example, lifecycle GHG analysis of waste-to-energy combustion grants credits for the emissions avoided due to electricity generated from organic waste (biogenic carbon) that displaces electricity generation that could be carbon-emitting. As electricity grids decarbonize, this credit approaches zero. Long-term emissions planning needs to account for such dynamics to realistically assess the GHG mitigation potential associated with alternative waste management strategies. Here, we seek to capture these dynamics in a forward-looking analysis of waste sector emissions under a zero-waste strategy for the City of Boston. Using publicly available data sets such as EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM), we show that the implementation of zero waste strategies reduces the combustion of plastics and biomass in waste-to-energy (WtE) combustion facilities and associated GHG emissions. While WtE has been considered less-carbon intensive than other forms of waste treatment and fossil-based electricity generation, our analysis shows that more renewables will eventually eliminate the perceived GHG benefits associated with waste-to-energy combustion. While our approach provides policymakers with an understanding of the impacts of decisions in a dynamic context, we also identify common knowledge gaps in conducting forward-looking waste-GHG assessments.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Dewatering of plastic films is a highly energy-consuming recycling operation that largely affects the quality of the recycled product. Despite the importance of good drying, this operation has not been studied at laboratory or pilot plant scale. In this work, the mechanical dewatering of blown film grade high density polyethylene has been assessed by using a laboratory centrifuge. It is suggested that a plastic cake is formed under the centrifugal forces similar to the sludge cake after the filtration process. The water is retained within the plastic cake due to three phenomena: free water within the cake pores and voids, water maintained by capillarity (superficial and pendular) and water trapped due to the tortuosity of the plastic mass. The total moisture is a sum of an equilibrium moisture and a transient moisture. The equilibrium moisture depends on the centrifugal force (G) but it is independent of time. Conversely, the transient moisture is reliant on both the G-force and the centrifugation time. The experimental results showed that an optimum side length exists. The moisture content is minimized when the flake side lies between 1 and 2\\u202fcm. Finally, it has been found that the moisture content is a function of the plastic surface. Hence, the specific moisture content (the mass of water per total plastic surface) should be calculated to compare films with uneven thickness or made of different materials. In sum, the outcomes of this study may be fundamental for the further and more extensive research into the plastic films dewatering processes.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyethylene terephthalates (PET), which are highly resistant to degradation under natural environmental conditions due to their inert, hydrophobic and high molecular weights, are collected in landfills or dispersed as waste. Considering the increasing use of PET, the interest in multidisciplinary studies aimed to obtaining high value added products from PET wastes has increased. In this study, the potential of using waste plastics made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) treated with bacteria as an aggregate in the production of mortar was investigated. First, the bacterial strains, which secreted esterase or cutinase, were screened for their ability to attach to hydrophobic surfaces and biofilm formation. TH401, which showed potential for the modification of the PET aggregates, was identified as Bacillus safensis. To enhance the compatibility of the PET, the waste PET aggregates were treated with submerged fermentation via B. safensis TH401. The FTIR analyses conducted after the treatment showed that the chemical structure of the PET had been modified. Mortar samples were prepared by using the modified PET aggregates. The compressive and flexural tensile strength values of the samples were measured on days 7, 28 and 56. The compressive strength values of the bacteria modified samples were 4.87%, 7.51% and 13.13% higher than the non-bacterial samples at 22 °C, 30 °C and 50 °C, respectively. The increase in curing temperatures had a positive effect on compressive and flexural tensile strength values. The highest strength values were obtained in the samples cured at 50 °C. In the EDX spot of the mixtures, major peaks of C, O, Ca were detected indicating the presence of CaCO3 and bacteria. Stratification on the PET surface as a result of bacterial modification was clearly observed in the SEM images. The test results showed that bacterial modification contributed to the increase in the strength of the waste PET aggregate concrete. It can be said that mortars produced with bacteria modified PET aggregates can be used as an economical and environmentally friendly material alternative in the construction industry.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Statistical entropy has been proposed as a metric of the quality of a mixture of materials, capturing its degree of complexity. An often overlooked challenge to applying this metric lies in the selection of material categories (e.g. metals and plastics vs. steel, aluminum, polyethylene, …) considered when evaluating the mixing complexity of a resource. The difficulty becomes particularly apparent when applying the metric to material mixtures from divergent origins or with very different make-up. This work develops an approach using statistical entropy with a multi-level material categorization scheme that is broadly applicable to different types of resources across all life cycle phases. In a case study, material mixing complexity is tracked across fourteen material mixtures found through the life cycle of a typical plastic packaging product. This includes the waste packaging bin, where other materials are embedded, and two end-of-life treatment scenarios: mechanical recycling and pyrolysis, where the waste product is chemically converted. A sharp deterioration of material quality is observed immediately after the product's use phase. Chemical and mechanical recycling show similar performance by the final stage of the life cycle, when secondary resources are produced. However, to reach this point chemical recycling shows multiple peaks of highly mixed resources while mechanical recycling shows a continuous decrease in mixing complexity throughout end-of-life. This approach presents a flexible method to characterize material mixing complexity as a resource quality indicator, enabling comparisons between disparate resources across typical industry- or use-boundaries, and potentially supporting decisions in product design and end-of-life treatment.\",\n",

Collective selective waste collection managed by authorised organisations (Extended Producer Responsibility, EPR), with or without Deposit-Refund Systems (DRS) are alternatives implemented at European level to handle this problem. Since there is no single simple formula that can be applied to every waste management system, this case study is focused on the entire Spanish model of one-way food packaging waste management, from collection of each fraction in specific containers to final treatment, considering eight different materials. For the analysis, six different impact categories were considered: abiotic depletion potential, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential and photochemical ozone formation. Results reveal that the recycling stage is the main stage contributing to the environmental impacts, but the environmental savings related to the recovery of materials in this stage compensates these loads and the system must be considered advantageous for the environment. By contrast, sorting plants present the lowest contributions and is the least significant stage. Significant environmental improvements (close to 10%) would be achieved by addressing the total bulk collection flow to mechanical-biological treatment and increasing the selective collection of light and glass packaging waste. This study can serve to identify common drivers that contribute significantly to the development of an integrated approach to waste packaging management and as baseline for comparison studies with alternative waste recovery technologies and systems.',\n",

Therefore, new recycling alternatives are required before expected disposal increases occur in the coming years. This study aims to justify a new carbon fiber recycle method and to understand how carbon fibers corroborate improvements in the transition zone in concrete by controlling crack propagation during mechanical loading. Cylindrical concrete specimens were prepared with cement consumption of 370 kg/m³, water-cement ratio of 0.5, and addition of 2% carbon fiber waste in relation to the cement mass. Despite a lower workability in the fresh state, the mechanical performance of the new composite was improved in compressive strength and tensile strength, as shown by a 28-day test result. In order to explain the relationship of structure and property of the new composite, images of the fibers and fractured surfaces of the concrete were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The carbon fiber acts directly on the concrete cracking mechanism at the moment of rupture, restraining the formation of large cracks from microcracks and maintaining the transition zone of the coarse aggregate adhered to the matrix. The addition of carbon fiber waste into the concrete is potentially positive, for providing mechanical improvements that will reduce the maintenance needs and, consequently, increase the durability of concrete structures and the sustainability of constructions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The production of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing rapidly because of their outstanding physicochemical properties, which ultimately leads to an increasing amount of spent lithium-ion batteries reaching their end-of-life (EOL). Pretreatment of the discarded batteries is an indispensable part of recycling spent lithium-ion batteries. The batteries contain toxic chemicals and high-value metals that must be recycled to promote environmental protection and sustainability. This paper provides an overview of the current pretreatment methods employed in the recycling of spent LIBs. In particular, the article reviews various options (mechanical, chemical, and thermal pretreatment options) that can be adopted for the pretreatment of spent lithium-ion batteries and puts forward the recommendations for future research and development that will enable more efficient and cleaner technologies for recycling spent LIBs. The review emphasizes the safe pretreatment of the spent LIBs and provides an overview of the consequences of the individual pretreatment steps on the recyclability of the materials to be recovered, and LiCoO2 was chosen as the reference as most studies in the literature focus on LiCoO2 cathode materials. However, discussions on other battery chemistries have also been incorporated into the scope of the review.',\n",

Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced through recovery and recycling of resources from the municipal solid waste stream. In São Paulo, Brazil, recycling cooperatives play a crucial role in providing recycling services including collection, separation, cleaning, stocking, and sale of recyclable resources. The present research attempts to measure the greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved by the recycling cooperative Cooperpires, as well as highlight its socioeconomic benefits. Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, questionnaire application, and greenhouse gas accounting of recycling using a Clean Development Mechanism methodology. The results show that recycling cooperatives can achieve important energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and suggest there is an opportunity for Cooperpires and other similar recycling groups to participate in the carbon credit market. Based on these findings, the authors created a simple greenhouse gas accounting calculator for recyclers to estimate their emissions reductions.',\n",

In addition to facing the challenges of an insufficient supply of agricultural inputs, the Amazon region has also faced problems in managing industrial wastes, which are not well characterized and for which few recycling options are available. Within this context, this study aimed to expand the knowledge regarding the use of Amazonian biomass ash, for which an integrative system between bioenergy and fertilizer production and waste management was proposed. This study evaluated ash applied as an alternative fertilizer, focusing on the availability and uptake of nutrients and heavy metals in acidic soils and the P dynamics using 31P-NMR. Three soils with different SOM values were treated with one of three doses of mineral fertilizer, namely, ash (35 Mg ha−1), phosphate fertilizer (2 Mg ha−1), or a mixture of ash and phosphate (35 and 2 Mg ha−1, respectively), and Avena sativa was grown to verify plant availability and the treatment effect on growth. The experiment was conducted for 60 d in a growth chamber. The ash application in pure form and mixed with phosphate slightly increased the pH (0.3–0.5 unit) and promoted significant increases in the availability of P (∼212%), Ca (∼165%), Mg (∼110%), and K (∼32%). In SOM-rich soils, the high microbial activity favored the transformation of inorganic P into organic P (2–21%), preventing fixation. The ash applications promoted positive effects on biomass production (∼62%) and increased the uptake of P (∼306%), Ca (∼181%), Mg (∼131%), and K (∼38%). Thus, Amazon biomass ash could be an alternative fertilizer source, representing a sustainable option for local socioeconomic development and the establishment of a circular economy system.',\n",

The data for the mass, energy fluxes and environmental emissions were obtained from published literature and from site investigations, for the two systems being analyzed for environmental impacts. The application of LCA using Eco-Indicator 99 has made the comparison of the environmental impacts of the two milk packages possible. The results of this LCA study are discussed and the results reveal that the composite packaging has a slightly higher environmental impact than the plastic one. In addition, the environmental impact of raw material extraction is the highest in all of the life cycle stages except for disposal. The environmental impact of composite packaging mainly comes from the fossil fuels, land use and respiratory inorganics categories, while the plastic packaging mainly comes from the fossil fuels category. However, the composite packaging has a greater environmental impact because it has not been well recycled and reused. This environmental impact could be decreased by developing the technology to separate out polyethylene and aluminum from the packaging.',\n",

A novel approach, surface micro-alcoholysis treatment (SMAT), was proposed for improvement of froth flotation towards the separation of plastics. By means of the SMAT, binary mixtures of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were selective modified to achieve effective separation. The mechanism of SMAT was examined by multiple characterization tests, response surface methodology was employed for its statistical optimization and simulation of pilot plant was first applied. The results suggested that selective wetting could be achieved through SMAT. PET surface was partially replaced by hydrophilic oligomers after ester exchange reaction, leading to the final flotation separation. Based on Plackett-Bueman design, zinc acetate concentration, temperature and operating time were identified as the significant factors controlled in SMAT. The maximum validation separation purity of PET could even reach 99.25% under the optimal condition predicated by Box-Behnken design. Such condition was performed in detail as the mass volume ratio of 1:5 (poly mixtures: 2-ethylhexanol), 0.3\\u202fwt% addition of zinc acetate, temperature of 346.5\\u202fK, stirring intensity of 100\\u202frpm and operating time of 84.13\\u202fmin.

A cheap and environmentally friendly synthesis pathway for polyols is provided using depolymerization reactions of recyclable materials. The structures of the polyols have been demonstrated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Different NCO/OH ratios with calculated amounts of MDI were used to prepare polyols which were then employed during PU preparation and their effects on the resultant PUs were investigated. Solvent-free polyurethane adhesives were synthesized. Changes in the properties of PU synthesized by the addition of castor oil and boron species to the structure were also determined. The thermal behaviour of PU samples were characterized by DSC-TG; and functional group detection and covalent bonding formation were investigated via FTIR analysis.',\n",

Chemocatalytic strategies giving life to fuels, chemicals, and monomers promise to transform plastic pollution, barely addressed by incineration and mechanical recycling, into an opportunity. Under the motto “catalysis generates plastics and should handle their fate,” this review integrates fundamentals and applications of catalytic transformations of seven major plastics. Following algorithmic analysis of >400 articles and patents, it outlines relevant systems for 13 frontrunner routes based on heterogeneous, homogeneous, and biocatalysis. Given the predominance of off-the-shelf catalysts, it stresses transposable state-of-the-art systems of developed fields to foster design of materials. Based on recent system engineering analyses, it highlights more sustainable paths for implementation, unattended by current trends in industry and academia. It closes with a unified view and critical thoughts on research priorities to accelerate progress toward a sustainable plastic economy.',\n",

There exist a large variety of automated material recovery processes for recycling of such wastes but each with significant limitations. Of these, the separation based on differences in densities is advocated as the optimum process either for producing recycled products or preparing wastes for subsequent recovery processing. Density separation processes based on cyclone type density media separation (DMS) is presented as an important, potential method for increasing plastics recycling process capacities. It is demonstrated to have the capacity to separate a significantly larger range of particle sizes than those presently processed industrially. The mathematical relationship for the prediction of quality of typical LARCODEMS type density media separations by particle size and density as expressed by the Ecart Probable is presented. A proposed device configuration is presented for density media separation to optimize the recovery and purity of both density fractions produced. It is also suggested that to be economically viable, a large scale of operation is required for industrial plastics recycling operations recovering and producing a number of different plastics with a purity to be used as a substitute for virgin material.',\n",

Low germination rates were observed in site C (50%) and site G (50%) soil extraction treated rice seeds. The shortest root length (0.2377cm) was observed in site G soil treated groups, which is only 37.57% of that of the control soil treated groups.

In this review paper, a total of 49 studies were considered to formulate the application-based characterization of textile waste fibers comprehensively, to determine its appropriateness as a composite material in sustainable construction and geotechnical practices. This paper presents a plethora of innovative strategies for the cascaded use of textile fibrous waste by transforming it into non-hazardous secondary raw materials for potential environment-friendly and cleaner applications in the fields of building materials and geotechnical engineering.

The structures of the polyols have been demonstrated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Different NCO/OH ratios with calculated amounts of MDI were used to prepare polyols which were then employed during PU preparation and their effects on the resultant PUs were investigated. Solvent-free polyurethane adhesives were synthesized. Changes in the properties of PU synthesized by the addition of castor oil and boron species to the structure were also determined.

       " {'context': 'The main objective of this work is the development of a new sand concrete whose aggregates consist only of river (0/4 mm) or dune (0/63 mm) sand and recycled plastic aggregates (0/3.15 mm). The work has both ecological and economical interest, without forgetting the technological interest which can certain materials provide. Indeed, what is new in our case is the addition of plastic aggregates to sand concrete as well as the study of the acoustic properties of this material. Different compositions have been studied by replacing (in volume) the mineral sand with plastic aggregates. The envisaged proportions are: 0%, 25%, 50% and 75%. The work focused mainly on the study of the effect of the addition of plastic aggregates on the properties of the river sand concrete and dune sand concrete, such as the thermo-mechanical properties and microstructure, with particular emphasis on studying the acoustic properties. The results obtained showed that, although the compressive strength of the studied composites is slightly reduced, their qualities in thermal insulation and acoustics absorption are significantly improved. For substitutions of up 75%, the sound absorption coefficient and the noise reduction coefficient (NRCs) ranged between 0.15 and 0.6 and between 0.28 and 0.39 respectively. Based on the obtained results, the final product is a lightweight concrete which can be classified, according to ISO 11654, into the sound absorption classes D and E. It is able to integrate among the new building materials and to contribute to sustainable development, particularly in local construction (arid regions). In conclusion, the recycled plastic waste and the dune sand can be a suitable alternative to the classic building materials.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis is widely used as a waste treatment technology (thermal recycling), which can be an alternative to disposal in landfills. To investigate the applicability of pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) to recovery energy from plastic solid waste (PSW), the pyrolysis of PSW was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer under an inert condition. The PSW samples were heated under dynamic conditions from 25\\u202f°C to 1000\\u202f°C at four low heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 30\\u202f°C\\u202fmin−1). The decomposition behavior of pseudo-components was characterized by the deconvolution method using the asymmetric double sigmoidal function (Asym2Sig), and the data obtained were used to determine the kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by isoconversional methods, the compensation effect factor and master plot. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH and ΔS) and lifetime were estimated based on the thermogravimetric and kinetic data. In addition, a fixed-bed reactor and GC–MS were employed to identify some valuable products in pyrolytic oil. Three pseudo-components were identified, which had the main influence on pyrolytic performance. The kinetic parameters suggested the suitability of PSW pyrolysis, where the reaction models were found to be suitable for describing the thermal behavior of PSW pyrolysis. The simulation profile curves from the simplified kinetic expression based on the kinetic triplet and deconvolution results had a satisfactory agreement with experimental conversion curves. The thermodynamic parameters were consistent with other wastes used as a bioenergy feedstock. Plastic solid waste presents attractive characteristics for pyrolytic oil production. The main highlights achieved for this study indicate that the pyrolysis of plastic solid waste can be an important step for the development of a recycling system that can recover energy from these wastes in a clean and environmentally friendly process.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The stability and performance of a two-stage anaerobic membrane process was investigated at different organic loading rates (OLRs) and Hydraulic Retention Times (HRTs) over 200 days. The Hydrolytic Reactor (HR) was fed with the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW), while the leachate from the HR was fed continuously to two Submerged Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors (SAMBR1 and 2). The Total COD (TCOD) of the leachate varied over a wide range, typically between 4000 and 26,000mg/L while the Soluble COD (SCOD) in the permeate was in the range 400–600mg/L, achieving a COD removal greater than 90% at a HRT of 1.6–2.3 days in SAMBR1. The operation was not sustainable below this HRT due to a membrane flux limitation at 0.5–0.8L/m2 h (LMH), which was linked to the increasing MLTSS. SCOD in the recycled permeate did not build up indicating a slow degradation of recalcitrants over time. SAMBR2 was run in parallel with SAMBR1 but its permeate was treated aerobically in an Aerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AMBR). The AMBR acted as a COD-polishing and ammonia removal step. About 26% of the recalcitrant SCOD from SAMBR2 could be aerobically degraded in the AMBR. In addition, 97.7 % of the ammonia–nitrogen was converted to nitrate in the AMBR at a maximum nitrogen-loading rate of 0.18kg NH4 +–N/m3 day. GC–MS analysis was performed on the reactor effluents to determine their composition and what compounds were recalcitrant.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Nowadays, the Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottle, which is a post-consumer product, has generated a strong interest in the environmental consequences that surround it, and a suitable alternative is to incorporate it in mortar and concrete. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate rendering mortars based on Portland cement/hydrated lime produced with PET bottle waste, used to partially replace 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% (by volume) of the fine aggregate in order to investigate the effectiveness and the improvement of these materials. The experimental program was performed in the fresh and hardened states, to determine flowability, fresh and hardened densities, air content, apparent porosity, water absorption by immersion, water retention, water absorption by capillarity, drying, water vapor permeability, ultrasonic wave velocity, and dynamic modulus of elasticity. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed. Generally, the results showed that the incorporation of PET significantly changed some properties, as verified by statistical analysis. Remarkable results from the incorporation of PET into rendering mortars based on Portland cement/hydrated lime are: close to 90% similarity of water retention between the mixtures, water absorption due to capillarity of M2.5 at 1.89 kg/(m2·min1/2), drying of the M15 specimen at 5.85 kg/m2, water vapor permeability of the M20 at 41.15 (ng/(m·s·Pa)) and the dynamic modulus of elasticity of M2.5 at 3.57 GPa. These replacements showed the possibility of mitigating the environmental impacts that the PET bottle life cycle can have and the extraction of the fine aggregate, promoting another possibility of disposal for this waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'To date, landfilling remains the most common waste management practice in Greece in spite of enforced regulations aiming at increasing recycling, pre-selection of waste and energy and material recovery. In this study, selected alternative scenarios aiming at minimizing the unused material fraction to be disposed of in landfills are analyzed, using the life cycle assessment methodology. The methodology was applied in the case of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Athens and Thessaloniki, with a special focus on energy and material balance, including potential global and local scale airborne emissions. Results are given in the form of indices efficiency, effectiveness, environmental and public health impacts. Material flow accounting, gross energy requirement, emergy intensity, emission and release intensity and morbidity or mortality indicators have been used to support the comparative assessment. However, not all options are equally benign to the local environment and to the health of the local population, since both the former and the latter are still affected by non-negligible local emissions. With regard to public health impacts, adverse effects on respiratory health, congenital malformations, low birth weight and cancer incidence were estimated. A significant and not intuitive result is the fact that life cycle analysis produces different conclusions than a simple environmental impact assessment based only on estimated or measured emissions. Taking into account the overall life cycle of both the waste streams and of the technological systems and facilities envisaged alters the relative attractiveness of the solutions considered.',\n",

Mitigating the adverse impacts of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) waste requires the cooperation of professionals from various fields. This paper discusses a novel, cleaner approach to soil stabilisation by repurposing the nitrile gloves into a sustainable road material to improve the mechanical properties of expansive clay soil as pavement subgrade. For the first time, extensive geotechnical testings, including standard compaction, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), unsoaked California bearing ratio (CBR), repeated load triaxial (RLT), and swelling-shrinkage tests, were carried out to investigate the engineering performance of different proportions of the shredded nitrile gloves (SNG) (e.g., 1%, 1.5%, 2%) were blended with expansive clay (EC). In addition, surface roughness, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray micro-CT analyses were conducted, and images were obtained to study the microstructural modification of the EC-SNG mixtures. The experimental results indicated that the blend of expansive clay with SNG helped in increasing the compressive strength, resilient modulus, and CBR and assisted in reducing the swelling and shrinkage of the soil. SEM and surface roughness analyses indicated the interaction between the soil matrix interface and the rough surface of the SNG. The main reasons for increasing the strength and stability of clay soil could be attributed to the high tensile strength of the SNG and the formation of the three-dimensional grid, and friction between the soil particles and SNG. According to the X-ray micro-CT test results, the incorporation of SNG led to an increase in closed porosity.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Construction materials research is consistently striving to improve sustainability, in the reduction of virgin materials by use of otherwise landfilled materials of the same purpose. Crumb rubber (CR) from end-of-life tires and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from post-consumer liquid containers are two of the most commonly circulating forms of waste in the urban environment. This study investigated the replacement of semi-dense asphalt (SDA) sand by untreated mechanically shredded CR and PET, at 2.5 and 5.1% respectively by total mass of aggregates. The mixtures were evaluated by compactability, indirect tensile strength (ITS), fracture energy (FE), water sensitivity by ITS ratio (ITSR%), surface texture and acoustic absorption tests. After compaction, the CR and PET samples experienced an elastic rebound effect, which resulted in the air voids being higher than expected. Also, the PET samples required more compaction energy. The ITS, FE and ITSR% were significantly reduced with CR replacement, while the PET mixture performed similar to the control, especially in FE. The sound absorption was related more to the air voids than the material type, although the absorption coefficients of the SDA was not found to be significant. The CR reduced the texture level of the pavement significantly in comparison to the control, while texture level remained the same for the PET mixture, despite a difference in the porosity. Further studies were performed using a mixture replacing PET by aggregate volume at 5.1%, comparing it to the control SDA in terms of low temperature cracking and permanent deformation at 50 °C. While the compactability of the PET mixture was now similar to that of the control, the resistance to cracking and permanent deformation was lower. Although the PET mixture had some interesting ductility properties, the replacement of sand by CR and PET is not recommended, and the more common use as asphalt mixture modifiers with fairly low addition contents of around 1% is more sound.',\n",

The novelty of the study, to the authors’ knowledge, consists in the fact that fibres have been employed as directly shredded from collected waste plastic bottles, with no processing through, e.g., plastic melting and fibre spinning. Moreover, a comprehensive investigation has been herein undertaken, which ranges from the identification of the mechanical behaviour of the fibres to the assessment of their bond with the matrix and of the early age and hardened state properties of the recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete. Different types of shredded recycled PET fibres, straight and deformed, together with different fibre lengths, 30mm and 50mm, have been assessed, for varying percentage addition in concrete. The tensile properties and pull out characteristics of the fibres have been determined. The effects of fibres in mitigating plastic and restrained drying shrinkage cracking were then assessed and, finally, the compressive strength and the flexural performance of the fibre concrete were determined. The cracking potential of fibre-reinforced mortar thin slabs was also assessed. The use of shredded recycled PET fibres in concrete has been shown to lead to interesting improvements in performance for various fibre concrete characteristics and offers a potential alternative for this material.',\n",

However, since environmental influences on natural materials are unique for different geographical locations in the world, the use of agro wastes from these locations need to be investigated. This work provides the detail results of the potentials of eggshell as HAp source. High-density polyethylene (HDPE)/HAp composites were developed by random dispersion of Hap (10, 20, 30 and 40 wt.%) in HDPE matrix, and were designated as HAC10, HAC20, HAC30, and HAC40. The HAp-filled HDPE composites were developed by a hot compression moulding process. The samples were subjected to tensile, flexural, impact, fracture toughness and wear tests according to ASTM standards in order to establish their structural performance as an implant material. Furthermore, the samples were also tested for hydrophilicity using tap water and simulated body fluid (SBF). X-ray diffraction analysis showed strong peaks of hydroxyapatite phase which established that the influence of the selected processing conditions on the poultry eggshell as a natural source for the biomedical application was suitable for the synthesis of high-quality hydroxyapatite. The mechanical properties of the developed composites were enhanced to the level of the required properties expected of an implant material compared to the control sample except for impact strength. Water absorption characteristics of the developed composite samples also displayed expected behaviour in SBF solution than in tap water thereby promoting the material as a good implant material. From the results, the sample with 40 wt.% HAp possess the highest values in the mechanical properties examined while sample from 20 wt.% had the best fracture toughness. The results revealed that these waste eggshells could be successfully converted into useful biocompatible HAp particles needed for the enhancement of the mechanical properties of polymer composites to meet the structural challenges of bio-composites.',\n",

A wide variety of solid wastes are generated, but only a few of them are employed in pavement structures. To achieve the task, papers between 2014 and 2019 from top journals which address waste management, waste characterization, and economic and environmental assessment were collected at first. Then, the scope of solid waste materials was narrowed down based on their applications, In the end, six most popular solid waste materials were selected for further study and for the review, namely recycled concrete aggregates, reclaimed asphalt pavement, fly ash, bottom ash, waste rubber, and waste plastics. The reason why only these six solid waste materials are selected is that the rest are neither massively produced not can they be directly used in pavement structures. This review article contains structural properties, treatments, novel researches, environmental analysis, and economic analysis of each solid waste material. The objective of this review article is to provide future researchers with the latest research findings, limitations and improvements in this subject. In conclusion, quite a few novel researchers in terms of workmanship, construction methodology, and treatments are collected for all six materials. Furthermore, an increasing number of findings have proven that most solid waste materials have both environmental and economic benefits when applied in field. Future researchers are encouraged to implement researches on solid waste materials in pavement engineering with consideration of both material properties and environmental/economic effects.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Upcycling of photovoltaic silicon (Si) waste to produce high-energy-density energy storage materials represents an effective way to achieve carbon neutrality. However, at present, photovoltaic Si waste (WSi) can only be suitable for degraded utilization because WSi recycling processes are limited by deep oxidation, entrainment of trace impurities, and structural reconstruction difficulties. Here, we propose an electrothermal shock method to convert photovoltaic WSi directly into ultrahigh areal-loaded (4.02 mg cm−2) silicon nanowire (SiNW) electrodes. High-gradient thermal fields (∼104 K s−1) are produced to drive the formation and deposition of gaseous Si molecules using the easy oxidation characteristics of the WSi powder. Carbon fiber cloth is used as both a heater and an in-situ growth substrate for the SiNWs to construct SiNW-carbon cloth self-supporting electrode (SiNWs@CC) structures. When used as a binder-free anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits ultra-high areal capacity (3.2 mAh cm−2 for 600 cycles, capacity retention rate >83%) and long-cycle stability (1706.2 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1800 cycles). A full battery assembled using a commercial LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrates stable cycling performance (>91.2% initial capacity maintained at 0.5 C for 250 cycles). Such an upcycling strategy will help to promote environmentally friendly, economical, and sustainable development of the photovoltaic and energy storage industries.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With the implementation of zero-waste city and waste classification in China, a large amount of food waste (FW) began to appear in concentration, and there was an urgent requirement for appropriate and efficient treatment technology. Traditional FW disposal methods (landfill and incineration) could cause several environmental problems, so resource recycling has become the main development trend of FW in China. In recent years, anaerobic digestion (AD) technology for FW resource treatment has attracted much attention due to its advantages such as the ability to obtain clean energy, low carbon emissions, and suitability for large-scale treatment compared with other recycling technologies (composting, feed, and breeding insects). Chinese policy is conducive to the development of AD for FW, which has the potential to produce methane and achieve economic and environmental benefits. This paper presents an overview of the researches, application situations, and perspectives for the AD of FW resource treatment in China. The bibliometric analysis shows that China has the most interest in the AD of FW compared to other countries, and the amount and characteristics analysis of FW indicates that FW is suitable for treatment by AD. At the same time, this review analyzes the influence factors, methods to promote AD, working mechanism, secondary pollution of AD. Besides, the article introduces and analyzes the current policies, application status, economic and environmental benefits, and problems of AD for FW resource treatment in China. AD is considered as an alternative resource treatment technology for FW, although there are still several problems such as odors, digestate, etc. In the future, China should focus on the reform of management policy, the implementation of the AD circular economy model, and the research of the biorefinery model based on AD technology.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Utilization of municipal solid waste (MSW) non-recyclable combustible fractions abundant in mixed plastics such as solid recovered fuel (SRF) is becoming increasingly widespread due to its sustainability. This study investigates utilization of pelletized mixed plastic SRF using fluidized bed (FB) flash pyrolysis at high temperature, unlike previous studies that focused on low temperature pyrolysis. The effect of temperature on the pyrolysis of SRF was investigated using an externally heated bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor having an internal diameter of 0.114 m and a height of 1 m. Experiments were conducted with an inert fluidizing agent (N2) in the temperature range of 600–900 °C. The pyrolysis products such as gas, char, and tar were analyzed, and the mass balance was determined. High temperature flash pyrolysis favors production of high LHV product gas unlike previous studies which were mostly focusing on liquids production. The gas yield increases from 0.285 g/gfuel to 0.680 g/gfuel with increasing temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C. GC–MS analysis of the tar revealed that increasing the temperature intensifies the cracking of naphthenes, alcohols, and olefins, and increases the relative percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons up to 85.1 % at 900 °C. When fluffy SRF was pyrolyzed, gas yield was slightly higher than the pelletized SRF at 800 °C suggesting that low temperature gradient increases gas yield and decreases char yield. Fluffy SRF pyrolysis tar also mainly consists of aromatics and esters. The process produces high calorific gas and reveals the reaction mechanisms relevant to gasification processes.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Strain hardening geopolymer composite (SHGC) processing superior tensile ductility and multiple cracking is a promising alternative to traditional ductile cementitious composites whereas the extremely high cost of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres limits its large-scale application. This paper presents a feasibility study of replacing PVA fibres with recycled tyre polymer (RTP) fibres to reduce the material cost of fly ash-slag based SHGC and ease the pressure on environmental impact induced by the vast amount of waste tyres, focusing on the influences of PVA fibre content (1.0–2.0% by volume) and RTP fibre replacement dosage (0.25–1.0% by volume) on the engineering properties especially uniaxial tensile behaviour, microstructure, material cost and environmental impact. Results indicate that the incorporation of RTP fibres into SHGC can lessen the loss in flowability and compressive strength due to the addition of PVA fibres. The drying shrinkage of SHGC containing RTP fibres is effectively reduced by about 35.69% and 17.33% as compared with the plain matrix and SHGC containing 2.0% PVA fibre, respectively. Although the presence of more RTP fibres diminishes the uniaxial tensile behaviour of SHGC, the cost and embodied energy of SHGC utilising RTP fibres are reduced by up to 34.52% and 16.23%, respectively. SHGC with 1.75% PVA fibre and 0.25% RTP fibre can be considered as the optimal mixture as it provides adequate engineering properties including a tensile strain capacity of around 2.5%, lower material cost and lower environmental impact compared to the typical SHGC with 2.0% PVA fibre.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With the limited supply of energies that we can extract or mine from the earth, low energy consumption building is indeed a demand for the present situation with the use of sustainable building materials. Owing to the frequent use of EPS in the packaging industry, the versatile use of non-biodegradable EPS contributes to increasing global waste generation. In this regard, the utilization of recycled EPS in concrete production can be a sustainable approach to manage embodied energy. EPS is a very lightweight thermal insulating material and is primarily used to prepare lightweight concrete and thermal insulation products in the construction sector. Currently, EPS-based cementitious composites are used in many building structures due to their excellent durability, thermal performance, and sustainability benefits. Several extensive studies have been carried out over a few years to maximize the hardened and durability properties of EPS concrete. With a number of building materials emerging, there is a lack of in-depth review studies on the performance of EPS aggregate concrete. The study underlines the influence of the addition of EPS to lightweight concrete in terms of mechanical, durability, and thermal insulation properties. The main contribution of this article lies in the exploration of subsequent additives, for the production of modified EPS to improve the performance of concrete. Further, the review is expected to provide substantial knowledge on the potential use of EPS, to promote sustainability in the construction sector.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With the development of modern waste management systems in Western Europe, a remarkable increase in the distances for waste transportation has been observed. The question thus arises whether recycling with longer transport distances is ecologically advantageous or whether disposal without recycling is to be preferred. This situation was analysed using selected product and waste streams. This included refrigerators, paper, polyethylene films and expanded polystyrene. For each of these streams, a life cycle analysis was conducted with an emphasis on waste transport. The system boundaries were set in terms of the generation of waste to recycling or landfilling. The comparison included several scenarios with recycling and different transport distances. Landfilling was used as the reference scenario. The results obtained demonstrated how transport distances influence the ecological benefit of recycling. In the case of expanded polystyrene, the ecological boundaries are reached in practical situations, while with other materials these boundaries are far from being attained. In these cases, more complex and elaborate collection schemes, such as kerbside collection, which is economically convenient and shows the highest collection rates, can also be recommended.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) in road pavement construction has been widely encouraged due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, the percentage of RAP is usually capped at low percentages as studies have shown that a high percentage of RAP might be detrimental to overall pavement performance. Recent research has shown that the addition of waste plastic materials such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) or their functionalized additives into asphalt pavement may potentially improve the durability of pavement and also help alleviate the environmental problems caused by plastic. The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using the additives, derived from waste PET through an aminolysis process, to improve the performance of bituminous mixtures containing RAP, by characterising the binder properties. To achieve this objective, binder samples composed of virgin bitumen, aged bitumen at various percentages, and PET derived additives, were prepared. These samples were then characterized through various laboratory tests, including dynamic shear rheometer, bending beam rheometer, moisture susceptibility, infrared red spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy tests. The results indicated that the samples containing RAP and PET derived additives provided better overall performance compared to the conventional binder, increasing the rutting resistance by at least 15% and fatigue cracking resistance by up to 60%.

       " {'context': '                  Although the extraction of value-added products from end-of-life plastics brings significant environmental and economic returns, the current recycling technologies are limited by their low efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we propose an efficient solar thermal catalysis to recycle various polyesters into high value-added monomer derivatives with low energy consumption and carbon emissions. Compared with the traditional thermal catalysis of homogeneous heating, the solar thermal process exhibits a unique localized solar heating effect, forming a temperature gradient from the solar absorber to the bulk solution. This effect allows a lower depolymerization temperature (150°C), but the recycling efficiency is increased by threefold, unattainable by thermal catalysis. Furthermore, the solar thermal process can reduce energy consumption by 3.7 GJ and CO2 emissions by 0.4 tons per ton of polyester treated compared with the thermal catalysis. Therefore, solar thermal catalysis opens an efficient, high-profit, and eco-friendly way to reuse waste plastics.               ',\n",

       " {'context': 'Packaging waste production, especially single-use containers, is exerting detrimental effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including human health. To internalise the externalities associated with single-use containers, different instruments, including a deposit refund scheme (DRS), have been operationalised in many countries. Therefore, DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro-environmental behavioural change. This study addresses the complexity of single-use plastic containers by analysing consumers’ perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland. Using 940 comments from the BBC “Have Your Say” messageboard, this study adopts sentiment analysis to understand consumers’ opinions about the introduction and implementation of DRS in Scotland. Findings suggest that a UK-wide scheme that is similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful. While consumers’ knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed, the efficacy of DRS including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to sustainability. The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post-consumer single-use plastic containers. The implications of the findings for policy and practice, especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The global consumption of plastic continues to increase, and plastic recycling is highlighted as crucial for saving fossil resources and closing material loops. Plastic can be made from different polymers and contains a variety of substances, added intentionally to enhance the plastic’s properties (metals added as fillers, colourants, etc.). Moreover, plastic can be contaminated during use and subsequent waste management. Consequently, if substances and contaminants are not removed during recycling, potentially problematic substances might be recycled with the targeted polymers, hence the need for quantitative data about the nature and presence of these substances in plastic. Samples of selected polymers (PET, PE, PP, PS) were collected from different origins; plastic household waste, flakes/pellets of reprocessed plastic from households and industry, and virgin plastic. Fifteen selected metals (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn) were quantified and the statistical analysis showed that both the polymer and origin influenced the metal concentration. Sb and Zn were potentially related to the production stage of PET and PS, respectively. Household plastic samples (waste and reprocessed) were found to contain significantly higher Al, Pb, Ti and Zn concentrations when compared to virgin samples. Only the concentration of Mn was reduced during washing, suggesting that parts of it was present as physical contamination. While most of the metals were below legal limit values, elevated concentrations in reprocessed plastic from households, aligned with increasing recycling rates, may lead to higher metal concentrations in the future.',\n",

Transformation of these waste plastics and solid biomass feedstock mixtures via co-pyrolysis can provide synergistic product enhancement for fuels and value-added products. The produced products can be used as chemicals and pollutant sorbents to foster eco-friendly pathways for waste management and sustainability. Progress into this avenue of waste disposal and energy production is the focus of this review. Properties of characteristic solid feedstock mixtures are discussed with focus on elemental composition, proximate analysis, and heating value. Effective H to C ratio of the different feedstocks is evaluated for asserting the quality of petrochemical equivalent products produced from co-pyrolysis of plastic wastes and biomass. The characteristics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density and low-density polyethylene (HDPE & LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and other major plastic waste components are discussed with focus on synergistic effects attainable by co-pyrolyzing them with biomass. State-of-the-art experimental methods for co-pyrolysis investigation are reviewed in detail using TGA, pyrolyzer, fixed bed reactor, fluidized bed reactor, microwave, and multi-step reactors using GC, MS, and FTIR diagnostics. In addition, different catalytic co-pyrolysis reactors are compared and discussed at different ratios of feedstock to catalyst, reactor temperature, and other operational parameters along with an in-depth understanding of several catalytic processing (ZSM-5 based catalyst, transition metal-based catalyst, multipurpose catalysts and ex-situ catalyst) for favorable products yield. Co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and solid biomass mixtures are reviewed for insights into liquid products for fuels and chemicals, as well as yield and composition of gases and solid residues evolved along with surface characteristics of the solid residues obtained from the selected configurations. The challenges and opportunities envisioned for the development in co-pyrolysis of several solid organic waste and plastic feedstock mixtures are also discussed. The goal was to provide favorable feasible pathways for clean and efficient disposal of plastic wastes with the incorporation of waste biomass for enhanced synergistic effects in waste disposal along with the recovery of energy and value-added products.',\n",

This paper summarizes the current published literature until 2015, discussing the material properties and recycling methods of plastic and the influence of plastic materials on the properties of concrete. To provide a comprehensive review, a total of 84 studies were considered, and they were classified into sub categories based on whether they dealt with concrete containing plastic aggregates or plastic fibers. Furthermore, the morphology of concrete containing plastic materials is described in this paper to explain the influence of plastic aggregates and plastic fibers on the properties of concrete.

       " {'context': 'Using recycled rubber waste in the construction of asphalt pavements not only improves pavement performance, but also promotes sustainable development. Consequently, rubber asphalt pavements have received significant attention in recent years. However, conventional rubber asphalt has numerous disadvantages such as low solubility, high viscosity, uneven dispersion, and poor storage stability. In this study, a composite method involving waste engine oil addition and microwave desulfurization to prepare highly dissolved rubber asphalt was proposed. Four types of rubber asphalt—conventional rubber asphalt, microwave-treated rubber asphalt, rubber asphalt with added waste engine oil, and highly dissolved rubber asphalt using the proposed composite method—were prepared and tested. The solubility, rheological properties, and storage stability of the prepared rubber asphalt specimens were studied. Specifically, the extraction of undissolved rubber was used to characterize the solubility of rubber asphalt. The results demonstrate that the solubility of the highly dissolved rubber asphalt prepared using the composite method was around 40%, which is 10%–20% higher than that of conventional rubber asphalt. The low-temperature performance and storage stability of the highly dissolved rubber asphalt improved significantly, and it also exhibited good high-temperature performance. The findings obtained herein indicate that the proposed composite treatment method for waste crumb rubber can significantly improve the performance of rubber asphalt, thereby promoting the application of rubber asphalt in the construction of asphalt pavements.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Nonmetals from the waste printed circuit board (NPCB) is the byproduct of waste printed circuit board recycling industry. The recycling of tons of NPCB for a clean environment and value-added product is still a great challenge. In this work, the possibility and feasibility of using NPCB to fabrication value-added thermal management materials are evaluated for the first time. The mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, dielectric performance and heavy metal leachate were studied. Due to the high aspect ratio of NPCB, the maximum tensile strength of LDPE/GNP/NPCB composites are increased from 24.9 MPa to 36.2 MPa and storage modulus maintained at 1403 MPa in 100 °C. Such data is much higher than those reported in the literature for LDPE/GNP composites and shows great potential for thermal management products. When increased NPCB content to 50 wt%, finite element simulation indicated that graphite nanosheets (GNP) interconnect and more heat flux is propagated through thermal conductive filler. The maximum thermal conductivity of LDPE/GNP/NPCB composites is increased from 1.0 W/mK to 1.6 W/mK. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of all samples is above 109 Ω cm, and the composites show low dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss, meeting the requirements of insulating and thermally conductive materials. The heavy metal leaching results show that after 20 days, the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ba, Cr, and Ni ion are far below the regulatory limits. This work not only provides a promising strategy to resolve NPCB environment pollution but also value-added products in thermal management applications.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Under the environmental perspective, textiles represent the fourth highest pressure commodity worldwide. In Europe, it is estimated that over 95 Mt of textile waste are generated along the entire supply chain, with still high percentages of textiles addressed to landfill or incineration. The present research, through a systematic literature review on textiles production and consumption, investigates their environmental concerns assessed through the application of the life cycle assessment. Considering the importance of identifying the products’ life cycle hotspots on which actions are needed to reduce the overall impact, the manuscript focuses on the environmental performance related to the cradle-to-grave phases of textile products differentiated by type, composition, and intended use. It results that the production and use phases are those responsible for the greatest share of negative impacts, while the end-of-life generally has a small contribution. Distribution and consumption phases are less investigated, and considering the emerging consumption patterns (e.g., sharing and renting platforms), it seems essential to collect data. Circular practices can bring benefits under the environmental perspective, but in-depth studies are still required to estimate the shift of impacts from one phase of the life cycle to another. Overall, there is a paucity of studies comparing the use of different fibers, ownership models, manufacturing and disposal processes for the same functional unit, or data that would be necessary for low-impact design. The topic is still under-researched among academics and practitioners of the textile industry.',\n",

Highway MSE wall base failures can cause significant maintenance, repair, and cost implications for the state department of transportation. Controlling base movement using Recycled Plastic Pins (RPP) can be a potentially cost-effective and sustainable solution. RPPs are primarily manufactured from recycled plastics and have been successfully used for stabilizing shallow slope failures. The objective of the current study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using RPPs for increasing the sliding resistance of an MSE wall. Four field test sections were constructed, out of which three were reinforced with different combinations of RPP sizes and spacings, while one was left unreinforced as a control section. Regular performance monitoring of the test sections was conducted using vertical inclinometers along with earth pressure plates. More than a year of results indicated a 75–88% reduction in lateral displacement of the reinforced wall base when compared with the control section. Additionally, the lateral earth pressure on the wall facing was decreased by 55–72% in the reinforced sections compared to the control section.',\n",

In many developing countries PET bottles are used in construction, mainly as fill-in material in concrete or adobe walls. Special purpose PET bottles have been designed and produced earlier that can be stacked in wall systems. In our research we produced a special PET bottle that fulfils the following conditions: (a) produced with blow-moulding technology; (b) good stacking features to eliminate or minimize binding medium between PET bottles; and (c) produced out of recycled PET. This special PET bottle resulted in a series produced and patented brick called PET(b)rick 1.0. We subjected the PET(b)ricks to various tests as done on regular building bricks: stress, pressure, and heat-freeze. PET(b)rick has reasonable resistance to stress greatly dependent on the filling medium, low resistance to pressure, and a small bandwidth of performance in heat-freeze. We have demonstrated stable and safe application of PET(b)ricks in small seating objects. PET(b)rick does not seem suitable as a self-standing wall, but can function as easily stackable fill-in material within a load-bearing structure.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With water treatment plants providing a viable solution for removal of microplastics from the environment, this review examines the overall and stage-wise efficiency of various water treatment technologies in removing microplastics and the technologies for managing water treatment wastes. More than 80 scholarly papers published in the past 10 years were reviewed. This review showed highly variable efficiency of the water treatment technologies with primary treatment of wastewater treatment plant reported to remove 16.5 to 98.4% microplastics. Secondary treatment of wastewater treatment plant has overall microplastics removal efficiency ranging from 78.1 to 100% and stage-wise efficiency from 7% (activated sludge) to 99.9% (membrane reactor). Tertiary treatment removes an overall 87.3% to above 99.9% microplastics. Initial coagulation and sedimentation of drinking water treatment plant can normally remove 1.8% to 54.5% of microplastics though advanced treatment pushes microplastics removal to overall 88.6%. Use of larger-than-normal dose of flocculent experimentally significantly increases microplastics removal up to 62%. The largest fraction of microplastics removed conventionally is trapped in sludge. This review highlights the feasibility of water treatment for removal of microplastics from water sources but reveals sludge and membranes as significant sources of microplastics from water treatment. It recommends enhancement of water treatment through adjustment of coagulants, potential use of emerging sol-gel technology and incorporation of advanced treatment for more efficient removal of microplastics. It advocates thermal pretreatment of sludge to potentially facilitate microplastics breakdown and recycle of membrane to reduce re-entry of microplastics into the environment.',\n",

It has resulted into degradation of a broad range of habitats and ecosystems by destroying natural functions, water quality, and environmental sustainability. However, the government agencies, scientific communities, and the public, have started to give attention to this issue. So, in the present study, we used the correlation methods to check the relationship between COVID-19 affected population with the medical plastic waste (MPW) that has developed a conceptual model of the inter-linkages between the preventive measures of COVID-19 pandemic problems and the reduction challenges of plastic waste during and after pandemic scenarios. Emerging issues in the waste management during and after the COVID-19 are established by reviewing the literature, reports, policy briefs, and information from the website concerning COVID-19. Considering MPW management issues, we selected India as a case study to analyse the plastic waste footprint (PWF) due to COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation results showed COVID-19 affected population and MPW; COVID-19 affected population and PWF have a significant relationship (R2 = 0.60; Area under ROC curve 81.4%). It suggests an urgent need for plastic waste management initiatives. Moreover, substantial plastic products, human awareness, strict government regulations, and inclusive research can check plastic waste footprints in India and worldwide. Then discuss the specific pathways through which the immediate and long-term impacts operate and highlight the issues of hampering the sustainable development goals (SDGs) progress in India and beyond. Finally, call for coordinated assessment, support and appropriate short- and long-term mitigation and the policy measures of plastic waste problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Zero waste manufacturing (ZWM) is a concept to support countries transition to a circular economy by developing manufacturing technologies and systems that eliminate waste across entire waste value chains to the fullest extent possible through reuse and recycling. Implementation of ZWM, particularly in dense urban settings such as Singapore, presents challenges for stakeholders, which stem from issues related to land scarcity, productivity, and labor shortage. A framework to address these challenges is proposed comprising six themes of design for zero waste, smart waste audit and reduction planning, smart waste collection, high-value mixed waste processing, collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis, and waste to resource conversion and recycling. A systematic literature review is used to examine industry technologies and research across the six themes to determine how the technologies can support ZWM. The research reveals that a variety of mature waste measurement, collection, and conversion technologies can be integrated through internet-of-things applications and a collaborative platform for industrial symbiosis to support Singapore and other countries in developing a ZWM ecosystem. This research examines the technical limitations of implementing ZWM technologies in dense urban settings using Singapore as a case study. Future areas of research are then proposed to overcome the implementation barriers so that ZWM can be enabled.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) plastic and stamp sand are both waste materials that impose a significant burden on the environment. This study investigates the potential of using stamp sand and ASA plastic composite as the pavement structure. It should be noted that this new material does not use the asphalt binder. A series of lab tests usually used for asphalt pavement materials were employed for the stamp sand and ASA plastic composite material. The high-temperature properties were analyzed by the Hamburg wheel tracking device (HWTD), while the low-temperature performance was measured by the disc-shaped compact tension (DCT) test. The tensile strength ratio (TSR) was used to determine the moisture susceptibility and the dynamic modulus was used to assess the deformation characterize under various loads and frequencies, the coefficient of permeability was estimated by the water permeability test, and the mass loss of aggregate was estimated by the Cantabro loss test. The dynamic modulus results showed that the ASA mixtures have improved high-temperature deformation resistance as compared to the asphalt mixtures. The ASA mixture with 40% sand showed higher stiffness than the ASA mixture with 30% sand. The ASA mixtures have excellent rutting resistance and moisture damage resistance. The fracture energy of the asphalt mixture is 42–77% higher than the ASA mixture. The tensile strength ratio of the ASA and asphalt mixture are all larger than 0.8 and therefore satisfy the Superpave specification. The average coefficient of permeability of the ASA mixture is 6–10 times higher than the asphalt mixture in the same air void level. The average aggregate loss percent of the ASA mixtures is 9.2–10.8 times higher than asphalt mixtures. In summary, the implementation of stamp sand and ASA plastic mixtures may be a successful solution to mitigate the environmentally harmful effects of waste plastic and stamp sand, as well as assist in offsetting the cost and negative effects of the asphalt mixtures typically used for road surfaces.',\n",

The aim is to improve the brittle behavior of cementitious materials in strong acid environments as well as the improvement of the thermal insulation performance of the developed material. Mortars incorporating 0, 10, 30, 50 and 70% PVC as a replacement for natural sand were studied. Density, compressive and flexural strengths, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and thermal conductivity tests were performed to evaluate the properties of PVC-mortar composites. The resistance of different mixes to strong acids was examined based on 5\\u202fweeks’ of immersion in 5% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 5% nitric acid (HNO3) solutions. The results showed that the incorporation of up to 70% PVC into lightweight ductile mortars is possible, though values of compressive and flexural strengths and ultrasonic pulse velocity decreased with increase in PVC content. In addition, the use of PVC aggregates by natural sand replacement caused the resistance of mortars against strong acids to increase considerably. Based on the thermal conductivity results, mortars with higher PVC aggregates rates improved the thermal insulation of composite mortars.',\n",

Sand sized particles from surface (0–0.1 m) and subsurface (2.5–2.7 m) samples were composed of silica and calcite grains in a matrix of calcium alumina-silicate hydrate (C-(A)-S-H) with Ca/Si ratios of 0.5 ±0.3 and 0.9 ±0.3 respectively. Calcite content was also higher in surface samples indicating a greater degree of weathering and carbonation. This resulted in lower leachate pH for the surface samples (pH 8–9.6) compared to subsurface samples (pH 10–11.3). The waste displayed a high acid buffering capacity but low alkaline buffering capacity. Element release as a function of pH was similar for surface and sub-surface samples and between different size fractions. Leaching of contaminant metals was close to minimum values at the pH values produced by the crushed concrete but increased by several orders of magnitude at pH <5 (for Al, Pb, Cr and V) and pH >12 (for Al and Pb). Weathering and carbonation during long-term stockpiling, therefore, has a positive impact by producing a waste with stable pH and low metal leaching potential suitable for in-situ disposal as a void fill material.',\n",

In this study, an experimental investigation is established to understand the compression behavior of concrete by replacing natural aggregates with recycled tire rubber at different percentages, ranging from 10% to 50% by volume. In experimental testing, several compression tests were performed on cylindrical concrete samples, and a three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) system was used to analyze the compression behavior of concrete structures during deformation. The experimental results indicated that the behavior of concrete changed from brittle to ductile and their ability to absorb compression energy (compression toughness) improved by increasing the crumb rubber percentage. Using 3D-DIC system which has a potential to replace the conventional tools, cracks onset locations were detected, failure mechanism and crack progress were tracked, and critical strain values which are usually at the interface of rubber particles and concrete were located. Although the cost of rubber crumbs is high compared with that of natural aggregates, incorporating recycled tire rubber in concrete structures can solve ecological problems.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing waste segments in the world. This study investigates the use of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) and aqueous acid as co-solvent for the treatment of e-waste, specifically for the extraction of copper. Printed circuit board (PCB) was selected as the e-waste of study. In order to perform controlled experiments, melt-pressed Cu foil and polycarbonate sheets were prepared as surrogates for PCBs. It was found that a scCO2 and acid pre-treatment induced drastic morphological changes in the polymer, creating pores, cracks, and delamination. This finding was translated to the actual waste PCB system. This unique process involved the pre-treatment of the PCB with scCO2 and aqueous sulfuric acid at 120 °C and 148 atm for 30 min followed by leaching of the treated PCB in a solvent containing 2 M sulfuric acid and 0.2 M hydrogen peroxide at ambient conditions. Experimental results showed that 82% of the copper contained in the PCB was extracted in under 4 h. The characterization of the PCB demonstrated that the pre-treatment with scCO2 and acid induced the crystallization of the plastics (polymer component), creating pores and weakening the structure of the PCB, thereby enhancing the transport of the solvent to the buried metal interfaces. This novel process using scCO2 could reduce physical processing (e.g. grinding of the PCB) and acid usage during the extraction of Cu from e-waste, providing a greener alternative for current methods of recycling of metals, which are energy intensive with large environmental footprints.',\n",

The objective of this endeavor was to ascertain if a closed-loop model could be established with the discarded PET feedstock. In five separate formulations, up to 50% of the total polyol content (traditionally derived from petroleum-based feedstock) was replaced with the afore-mentioned sustainable recycled polyols. These foams underwent mechanical, thermal, morphological, and physical characterization testing to determine feasibility for use in an automotive interior. Young’s modulus, tensile stress at maximum load, tear resistance, and compression modulus all increased by combined averages of 121%, 67%, 32%, and 150% over the control petroleum-based formulation, respectively, in foams possessing 50% rPET polyol content. Thermal stability also increased with sustainable polyol content; thermogravimetric analysis showed that 50% mass loss temperature increased by an average of 20 °C in foams containing 30% recycled polyol. Properties of density and SAG factor remained within 5% of the control petroleum-based reference foams. After comparing these findings to traditional polyols, a compelling argument can be made for the use of post-consumer automotive and industrial feedstocks in developing high-performing interior automotive PU foams.',\n",

Here, moderate temperature (400–600 °C) slow pyrolysis was tested to transform a high-fidelity spacecraft solid waste simulant into nutrient-rich crop growth medium for food production in space, while recovering water and carbon dioxide. Qualitative results indicated that water recovered from a simple drying process was of poor quality. Produced biochars approximated the characteristics of saline-sodic soils with P, K and micronutrients, low nitrogen, and no meaningful heavy metals, which suggests applicability as growth media. Before being used as growth media, biochar would likely need to be rinsed to remove sodium and supplemented with a source of nitrogen. If uncatalyzed slow pyrolysis is to be used, observations suggest that the produced volatiles should be directly combusted and water recovered from the flue gas, rather than trying to condense and separate the watery bio-oil product. This proof of concept study determined that low-temperature pyrolysis can be used to generate biochar-based soil, which may support agriculture during spaceflight while recycling nutrients and water from waste materials.',\n",

However, information on the patterns and characteristics of flow, stock, and waste in the plastic life cycle and their driving factors is limited in China, and effective waste reduction and sustainable strategies are missing. Therefore, this research established a flow model of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET); further analyzed the driving factors; and proposed strategies for waste reduction and sustainable development. We found that the total consumption, stock, and waste of PET, PE, and PP in 2010–2017 reached 552.96, 292.70, and 257.18 Tg, respectively. Building and construction (B&C), packaging, and textiles were the sectors with the largest stock of PE, PP, and PET. From 2010 to 2013, the stock of PE increased by 440 %, which was mainly driven by the increase in material utilization intensity (MUI). Similarly, the growth of MUI was the main driving factor driving PP (351 %) and PET (367 %) stocks. Notably, from 2014 to 2017, economic growth was the main factor driving the plastic stock.

       " {'context': 'Polymer laminated aluminum packaging (PLAP) materials are very useful in high strength flexible packaging applications. Despite the advantages they can offer, there are several difficulties to recycle PLAP into its original metallic form. This study focuses on the effect of different polymeric laminates on the quality of the Al surface recycled by the thermal disengagement technology (TDT). Three different types of flexible PLAP materials have been thermally disengaged in an inert and air atmosphere in 5–30 min at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C. Released gases during the degradation of the polymers have been continuously monitored. After the thermal disengagement of the PLAP material, the surface oxidation was compared with the non-laminated aluminum surfaces that have gone through the same treatment process in the oxygen-enriched atmosphere for 20 min. Complete degradation of the polymers and the dissociation of the volatiles from the PLAP materials was achieved at 550 °C within 20 min of the heating process. IR gas analyzer detected hydrogen as the main component from the off gases along with some other greenhouse (CO, CO2) and hydrocarbon (CH4) gases. FTIR, XRD, SEM with EDS mapping, and XPS analysis of the disengaged aluminum (DAl) surfaces demonstrate the rate of oxidation on the non-laminated aluminum is 70–90% higher compared to recycled aluminum from the PLAP materials. A proper selection of TDT parameters minimizes the surface oxidation by the decomposition of the laminated polymers and provides optimum protection against oxidation of the aluminum by the polymers at the initial stage and its degradation components at the final stage by creating a barrier between the Al and surrounding atmosphere. This research shows a pathway to recycle complex packaging materials into less contaminated aluminum without any metal loss. Moreover, highly efficient fuel gas (mainly H2) and free carbon can also be isolated upon further processing of the off-gases and polymer degraded carbonaceous residue.',\n",

Consequently, the plastics recycling sector is increasingly confronted with higher demands on the sensory properties of recycled plastics from post-consumer packaging material. The objective of this study was to examine the sensory properties of two different post-consumer film fractions along a conventional recycling process by a combined sensory-analytical approach. Accordingly, sensory evaluations of two post-consumer film fractions, the associated washing water, a washed waste fraction and conventional recycled pellets thereof were performed by an expert panel, followed by the characterization of the underlying odorants by means of gas chromatography-olfactometry and (two-dimensional) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry. Using this targeted approach, in sum, more than 50 odorants were successfully identified along the processing chain. Most dominant was an array of typical metabolites formed by microorganisms such as cheesy smelling short chain carboxylic acids as well as sulphur or nitrogen containing odorants exhibiting, amongst others, garlic-like or fecal smells. Furthermore, two post-consumer film fractions sorted according to a defined geometry showed great similarities in the odor profiles as well as in the odorant composition. The negligible effect of the applied washing and the still high odor pollution of the recycled pellets demonstrate the urgent need for odor removal strategies in this field. Thereby, the chemical structures of the odorants obtained within this study provide key information on potential sources and formation pathways of odorants supporting the development of targeted deodorization methods.',\n",

The unprecedented growth trajectory in lithium-ion battery manufacturing perpetuated by the inception of electric vehicles (EV) results in a vast amount of spent LIBs reaching their end of life (EOL). From the perspective of resource circulation, procurement, and sustainability with an insight into the circular economy, an effective recycling system must be developed to recycle the spent LIBs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of pyrometallurgical options for recycling spent LIBs. In particular, this study summarizes the thermal pretreatment methods used to recover the active cathode material and then discusses the developed extractive pyrometallurgical options for recycling spent LIBs. A summary is presented on some recent examples of laboratory and industrial-scale recycling processes to demonstrate the practical applications of pyrometallurgical options for recycling. Finally, the review sheds light on the battery recycling legislation, and challenges and future outlook for recycling LIBs are also discussed.',\n",

This target can only be achieved by considering resource recovery from waste comprehensively. However, waste management measures have to be investigated critically and all aspects of substance-related recycling and energy recovery have to be carefully balanced. This article compares recovery methods for selected waste fractions with regard to their energy efficiency. Whether material recycling or energy recovery is the most energy efficient solution, is a question of particular relevance with regard to the following waste fractions: paper and cardboard, plastics and biowaste and also indirectly metals. For the described material categories material recycling has advantages compared to energy recovery. In accordance with the improved energy efficiency of substance opposed to energy recovery, substance-related recycling causes lower emissions of green house gases. For the fractions paper and cardboard, plastics, biowaste and metals it becomes apparent, that intensification of the separate collection systems in combination with a more intensive use of sorting technologies can increase the extent of material recycling. Collection and sorting systems must be coordinated. The objective of the overall system must be to achieve an optimum of the highest possible recovery rates in combination with a high quality of recyclables. The energy efficiency of substance related recycling of biowaste can be increased by intensifying the use of anaerobic technologies. In order to increase the energy efficiency of the overall system, the energy efficiencies of energy recovery plants must be increased so that the waste unsuitable for substance recycling is recycled or treated with the highest possible energy yield.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Solid waste management can be regarded as one of the major environmental concerns across the globe. Annually, substantial quantities of plastics are produced. The utilization of this waste can result in a variety of huge problems such as health hazards, disposal, and environmental pollution. In this paper, the workability and rheological characteristics of self-compacting high strength concrete (SCHSC) made with recycled polypropylene plastic particles (RPPP) with fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF) are investigated. The SCHSC was employed by replacing the medium-coarse aggregate (MCA) with five percentages of RPPP contents at 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% by volume. The first group of mixtures contained 20% FA and 80% Portland cement (PC). On the other hand, the second group of the mixes made with 20% FA, 10% SF, and 70% PC. To investigate such workability-related properties as slump flow diameter (SFD), T50 slump flow time (SFT), V-funnel flow time (VFT), L-box height ratio (LHR), and L-box T200 and T400 flow times, 10 concrete mixtures were produced and tested. ICAR rheometer in the rheological testing of fresh SCHSCs was used to determine the rheological parameters. For all mixtures, the compressive strength was measured at 28 days. With respect to the experimental results of the current study, the Herschel-Bulkley and modified Bingham models can provide well defined rheological representations for SCHSC with RPPP. The mixtures containing a combination of FA, SF, and RPPP can have better fresh characteristics compared to those without SF. Moreover, all produced SCHSC mixtures can be at a satisfactory level with the limitations required for the fresh properties of SCC.',\n",

       " {'context': \"China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a global development strategy with great potential for multilateral trade cooperation and economic growth in Asia, Europe and Africa. Commodities trade volumes across BRI countries have boomed in the last few years. However, the waste and scrap (WaS) trade, an important aspect of global waste management, has received little attention. In recent years, frequent trade frictions and restrictive import policies due to increasing environmental protection awareness have sent massive shocks through the international WaS trade system. Exploring the impacts of shocks on BRI-WaS trade is an important but unexamined research topic that can help ensure the steady operation of WaS recycling. To address this research gap, this study first provides a panoramic view of the BRI-WaS trade network and analyzes its structural relation to the global WaS trade network. Second, the hidden risks in the BRI-WaS trade are revealed by proposed shock propagation models in three real-life scenarios, namely, a unilateral trade disruption, a bilateral trade crash and an import ban. Third, the global circulations conceptual framework is mathematically examined in the BRI regional context. The findings reveal that BRI countries are increasingly important to global WaS trade and that BRI-WaS trade presents a heterogeneous structure with evenly distributed trade channels. The “most at-risk” sources in the BRI-WaS trade network are uncovered. The BRI circulation system is mathematically feasible but eco-ethically infeasible. Discussions are provided to support authorities in developing effective strategies to manage BRI-WaS trade and responses to future extreme disturbances as well as address the global WaS crisis.\",\n",

Although this method has been widely investigated for cast concrete, there is limited research on 3D-printed cementitious materials. This study explored the correlation between the compressive strength and microstructural property of 3D-printed rubberised mortar with cement-coated crumb rubber (15 wt% replacement of river sand). Multiple ratios of cement-to-rubber (C/R) were designed to achieve different coating qualities, including C/Rs of 0.25 (CR-0.25), 0.4 (CR-0.4) and 0.55 (CR-0.55). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed the existence of hardened cementitious shells outside the rubber particles, which effectively improved the interfacial bonding between the rubber surface and the cement matrix. The compressive strengths of the printed specimens did not always improve as the ratio of cement to rubber for coating increased. Moreover, the anisotropy in compressive strength was more obvious in the CR-0.4 and CR-0.55, where the strength in the Y (printing) direction was about 7 % higher than that observed in the Z (layer deposition) direction. X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis revealed that the mechanical anisotropy in CR-0.4 and CR-0.55 could be primarily attributed to two factors – pore morphology and pore orientation relative to the external loading direction. For CR-0.25, the rubber-to-matrix interface bonding appeared more critical for the compressive strength. Finally, the printed specimens showed the higher compressive strengths than the cast ones due to the lower fraction of large pores (diameters ≥ 1 mm).',\n",

The levels of BDE-28, BDE-153, pentabromotoluene (PBT), pentabromobenzene (PBB), ∑PBDEs and ∑BFRs in the water from FJ or TZ were found to be significantly negatively associated with the distance from the zone center. However, in the sediments from FJ and TZ, the BFRs levels did not decrease from the center to the outer regions. BDE-209 and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) were predominant in the sediments and the ratio of DBDPE/BDE-209 were as high as 5.6 (mean: 0.97). The mass burden of PBDEs, BDE-209, DBDPE, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), and HBB in the riverine sediments in Luqiao District was 829, 787, 363, 85, and 61 kg, respectively. The ecological risk assessment revealed that BDE-99 posed an unacceptable risk to aquatic life at 86% of the locations. The hazard quotients for penta-BDE, BDE-209, and HBB exceeded one for 30%, 28%, and 2.3% of the sediment samples, respectively.',\n",

       " {'context': '               This chapter discusses the techniques used for mechanically recycling waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Discarded personal computers (PCs), TVs, kitchen and audio equipment are among the most popular items to be recycled, yielding valuable polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polycarbonate, and different varieties of polystyrene. The process of mechanical recycling is to collect, sort, size reduce, separate, and densify these wastes, economically and effectively. The effectiveness of separation techniques such as flotation, hydrocyclone, air tabling, near infrared, and electrostatic sorting are examined. The variations in effective WEEE collection and treatment among European Union member states are also discussed. Future work with WEEE plastics is based on the acceptable use of immiscible polymers through processing or chemical modification. An alternative area of research is to make the polymers easier to separate, and research appears to be ongoing to minimize the use of different polymer types in a product, making the recycling process far simpler.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop enhanced modified bitumens with waste engine oil and recycled engine oil bottoms combined with polymers (waste polyethylene, crumb rubber and styrene-butadienestyrene), in order to minimize the use of bitumen. After a thermochemical characterization, different compositions were studied with penetration, softening point and viscosity tests. The bitumens modified with waste engine oil products and polymers have similar penetration values, and softening point temperatures higher than those of commercially modified binders.

       " {'context': 'The mismanagement of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) resulted in numerous discarded plastics in the natural environment, and these waste plastics might experience aging, breaking, and migration, which becomes a crucial microplastic source. Sustainable management of WEEE plastics presents a considerable opportunity for resource recovery and microplastic pollution prevention. Flotation separation is a significant process of mechanical recycling, while most flotation methods can only deal with binary plastic mixtures. In this work, an advanced, stepwise, and sustainable flotation method was advocated to separate multi-plastics by polymeric aluminum chloride (PAC) modification. The abundant hydrophilic groups and environmental friendliness of PAC prompted us to further investigate the wetting effect. PAC had varied hydrophilization effects on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polystyrene (PS) surfaces, but polyethylene terephthalate (PET) retained hydrophobicity. Treatment conditions, including PAC dosage, temperature, time, and pH were optimized. 100% of PET could be purified after primary separation, and the purities of ABS and PS could reach 100% and 97.4% after secondary separation, respectively. The strength of the interaction was determined by the different surface potentials and functional groups. In PAC solution, long-chain molecules or ions might interact with plastic surfaces electrostatically, and Al3+ could bridge long-chain molecules and plastic surfaces, thereby strengthening the polymer hydrophilicity. We further improved the PAC treatment process, and the reuse of PAC reduced modifier usage to 84.4 g/ton waste plastics, which was cost-effective in industrial applications. A preliminary evaluation of the energy consumption and environmental impact indicated that PAC treatment was superior to other modification methods. This work is an initial attempt at the stepwise separation of waste plastic and shows promising prospects for recycling plastic waste.',\n",

       " {'context': \"The recycling of waste cooking oil (WCO) has attracted increasing interest while most research is connected to fuel and bio-lubricant production. The study aims to extend the possibility of applying WCO in asphalt modification to achieve environmental and economic benefits. Another nature-generated modifier, European rock asphalt (ERA), was also involved in compensating for the adverse effect of WCO on asphalt's high-temperature performance. Different ratios of WCO and ERA were adopted for preparing modified asphalt. The performance of asphalt, before or after aging, was evaluated with conventional tests (such as penetration, softening point, ductility, storage stability) and rheological tests, including Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) test. The results indicated that WCO improved asphalt's resistance to low-temperature cracking by decreasing the creep strength and creep rate. The addition of ERA could counterbalance the detrimental effect of WCO on asphalt performance in high temperatures. Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to investigate the modification mechanism, and no clear indication for a chemical reaction was observed. Modified asphalt at a proper ratio (4% WCO and 15% ERA for the investigated asphalt) can also present qualified storage stability, temperature susceptibility, and aging resistance. Finally, economic and environmental analyses were performed by comparing the cost and energy consumption of producing the performance grade level of asphalt in a traditional way or by this novel modification with WCO and ERA. The results indicated that modification of WCO and ERA could save more cost and cause less energy consumption.\",\n",

The detection of the failure mechanisms of the examined yarns was confirmed via SEM analysis and images captured by high-speed camera. The twist factor at low twist level (550 TPM), twist ratio (0.1) and impregnation rate (0.3 cm/s) were determined as optimum twist factors to produce plied yarn-reinforced composite with high tensile strength of 286 MPa. The optimum twist of single yarn reinforced composites was 0.76 times the optimum twist of the single yarn alone. Twisting significantly influenced the manufacturing of high-performance composites from waste-derived yarn.

Two main sources of chlorinated pollution in municipal solid wastes, namely food waste and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), were used as raw materials for SRF production. These materials were dechlorinated using alkaline adsorbents (calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)), yielding five sample SRFs. The SRFs had low heating values (LHVs) of 14.10–15.12 MJ/kg. The alkaline adsorbents were introduced during dry dechlorination, which increased the LHVs by 8.4 MJ/g. Approximately 50 % of the total Cl content was transformed into the liquid and gaseous phases after incineration of the SRF. The PVC content was increased to increase the amount of gaseous Cl produced. Conversely, the yields of liquid and solid Cl increased when the FW content was increased. Among alkaline adsorbents, Ca(OH)2 exhibited better adsorption performance than NaHCO3. Upon mixing ~15 wt% of Ca(OH)2 with the SRFs, the highest Cl removal efficiency (77 %) in the gaseous phase was achieved. Over 90 % of the total Cl content was converted into solid-phase calcium chloride and sodium chloride by the alkaline adsorbents. The total cost of the SRF was US$85.48/t, of which labor and electricity costs accounted for 50 % and 25 %, respectively.',\n",

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this work, the concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were determined in air, dust and fly ash samples from three legal waste electrical and electronic equipment dismantling plants with strict pollution controls. The risks posed by PBDEs to workers at the plants were assessed. The atmospheric concentrations of PBDEs in the different e-waste recycling workshops were 0.58–2.89\\u202f×\\u202f103\\u202fng/m3, and predominantly distributed in the particle phase (90.7%–99.9%). The concentrations of the PBDEs in the floor dust and fly ash samples from bag-type dust collectors in different workshops were 2.39–125\\u202fμg/g, 5.84–128\\u202fμg/g, respectively. The contributions of BDE-209 in air, floor dust and fly ash samples were 84.0%–97.9%, 11.2%–95.3% and 74.0%–94.9%, respectively, indicating that deca-BDE commercial formulations were their major sources. Daily exposure to PBDEs was also lower than has been found for workers in other recycling workshops. Human exposures to BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153, and BDE-209 were all below the levels considered to pose appreciable risks. Dust ingestion was the main exposure route for manual recyclers, and inhalation was the main exposure route for waste transportation workers. The results of this study indicate that PBDEs emissions and risks are lower in modern, legal e-waste recycling facilities with effective pollution controls. However, the effectiveness of the pollution controls need to be further researched in plastic crushing areas.',\n",

Plastic can be classified into two types: thermoplastics and thermosetting and are divided into 7 different categories: (Polyethylene Terephthalate [PETE], High-Density Polyethylene [HDPE], Polyvinyl Chloride [PVC], Low-Density Polyethylene [LDPE], Polypropylene [PP], Polystyrene or Styrofoam [PS] & Polycarbonate or ABS [others]). To curb the deleterious effects of plastic waste various methods have been devised and utilized that include chemical, physical and biological treatments. One of the aspects primarily focused by the researchers is the phenomenon of biodegradation and there are many microorganisms (bacteria) that have the ability to carry out this particular process. These bacteria assist biodegradation by production of several enzymes like PETases and MHETases. There are few microorganisms that have been listed which cannot be applied for industrial use due to its low biodegradation capacity. To overcome this problem, PHA is one of the alternatives to replace the synthetic plastic due to its high degrading capacity.',\n",

Human exposure to MPs occurs largely through ingestion. Polyethylene (PE) is widely employed for reusable bags and food packaging and found to be present in drinking water and food. It is also one of the major polymers detected in human stool. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of intestinal exposure to PE MPs on gut homeostasis. Mice were orally exposed for 6 weeks to PE microbeads of 2 different sizes, 36 and 116 μm, that correspond to those found in human stool. They were administrated either individually or as a mixture at a dose of 100 μg/g of food. Both PE microbead sizes were detected in mouse stool. Different parameters related to major intestinal functions were compared between control mice, mice exposed to each type of microbead, or co-exposed to the 2 types of microbeads. Intestinal disturbances were observed after individual exposure to each size of PE microbead, and the most marked deleterious effects were found in co-exposed mice. At the histomorphological level, crypt depth was increased throughout the intestinal tissues. Significant variations of gene expression related to epithelial, permeability, and inflammatory biomarkers were quantified. Defective recruitment of some intestinal immune cells was observed from the proximal portion of the small intestine to the colon. Several bacterial taxa at the order level were found to be affected by exposure to the MPs by metagenomic analysis of cecal microbiota. These results show that ingestion of PE microbeads induces significant alterations of crucial intestinal markers in mice and underscores the need to further study the health impact of MP exposure in humans.',\n",

The unpredictable variations in the quantity and composition of waste also pressurize policymakers to react dynamically. This review highlights the major problems faced during the pandemic by SWM sector and the underlying possibilities to fill the gaps in the existing system. The review focuses on particular areas that have been the most important cause of concern throughout the crisis in the process of waste management. In addition, the mixing of virus infected biomedical waste with the stream of normal solid waste and lack of active involvement of the citizen and cooperation presents the major negative safety and health concerns for the workers involved in the sanitation process. Apart from presenting innovative solutions to tackle current waste management issues, this study also proposes several key potential guidelines to holistically mitigate possible future pandemics, if any. This article can also be of great implication for creation of a specific strategy towards preventing/controlling any potential pandemic of similar kind in the near future.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The current worldwide expansion of waste PCB (WPCB) deposits represents both a pressing environmental issue and an economic opportunity, fostering the development of numerous recycling processes across the world. An important input for designing such processes is the metallic content of WPCBs, which is assayed by grinding and leaching samples taken from the stack of WPCBs to be recycled. The content values come with substantial uncertainties, arising mainly from the uneven distribution of the metals within the structure of WPCBs. This study aims to quantify the effects on these uncertainties of the particle size, the mass of the sample digested and the number of digestion replicates. It focused on the abundance of six metals in WPCBs: Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb and Ni, and also Co, which is a critical element for the EU. A batch of 485 kg of WPCBs was put through several shredding and splitting steps to produce three fractions: one shredded to 2 mm, and two ground to 750 μm and 200 μm. From each sample, 16 samples of 0.5 g, 2 g or 5 g were digested in hot aqua regia. Bootstrapping of the results allowed the error around the mean content to be estimated, for each metal and for all the experimental conditions. Considering the largest sample masses and three replicated digestions, the uncertainties for Zn (resp. Ni) were reduced from 35% to 10% (resp. from 70% to 10%) when the particle size was reduced from 2 mm to 200 μm.',\n",

Their syntheses usually involve the use of aromatic diisocyanates and polyols coming from fossil-based resources, in the presence of tin-based catalysts, which present a very well-known toxicity. In the last years the increase of environmental and economic issues related to the depletion of limited sources, the increase of greenhouse gas emissions, the release of toxic degradation compounds and the catalyst contamination has shifted the attention toward more sustainable solutions. In this study a low-impact, sustainable and efficient procedure for the synthesis of bio-based PUA promoted by solid supported CeCl3·7H2O–NaI/SiO2 was developed. This catalytic system provides the target compounds with good monomer conversion and molecular weights and allow the synthesis under heterogeneous conditions as main advantage, with the final recovery of the catalyst. We also confirmed its rapid separation, stability, and efficient recycling of the catalyst, obtaining comparable results over a seven reactions cycles. The goodness of the polymerization process under heterogeneous condition was confirmed by chemical and thermal characterizations.',\n",

These particles can act as carriers of environmental chemical pollutants and pesticides. Absorption of these particles by living organisms, especially aquatic organisms, may cause changes in the gene expression as well as enzymes activity in the antioxidant pathway. In this study, combined and individual effects of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics, as one of the most widely used plastics in industry, and abamectin (ABM) pesticide was evaluated on glutathione content, total antioxidant capacity, free radical scavenging, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a (cyp1a) gene expression in zebrafish. The results indicated that microplastics (MPs) in combination with pesticides reduced the content of glutathione. The gene expression of cyp1a showed significant decreased in zebrafish after treatment with ABM alone and in combination with microplastic, while the expression of vtg gene was significantly increased in samples treated with combination of ABM and MPs. Analysis of antioxidant activity revealed that glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase and DPPH activity were not affected by MPs when applied alone, but it increased the total antioxidant capacity and also inhibited the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. ABM had no effect on glutathione peroxidase and DPPH activity, but it reduced SOD activity. Also, the combination of microplastic and toxin increased glutathione peroxidase activity and decreased the glutathione content, SOD and DPPH activity. In general, the result of this study demonstrated that the effect of MPs cannot be ignored in increasing the toxicity of other pollutants.',\n",

       " {'context': 'We fabricated a porous Ag–TiO2 film with a nanocage (NC) like structure as a sensitive, recyclable, and low-cost SERS substrate using facile methods. The developed nanocage structure of TiO2 film was first coated on a glass plate by doctor-blade method, and then thin film of silver with an optimum thickness of 10 nm was deposited onto it using thermal evaporation method. The unique mesoporous cage-like structure of TiO2 film leads to the exceptional and non-uniform growth of Ag film. The developed Ag nanostructure is also porous, caps spherical in shape, and the average separation between two consecutive nanostructures is 10 nm. These closely decorated nanostructures of Ag produce hotspots by localising the incident electric field within the minimal volume. The unique nanocage structure of TiO2 film provides a larger effective surface area of adsorption to the analytes. Thus, the synergistic effects of Ag–TiO2 NC structure exhibit significant enhancement of 108 considering rhodamine-6g (R6G) molecule as a probe using a portable handheld Raman spectrometer. The amount of electromagnetic enhancement was further investigated by 3D FDTD simulation that matches well with the experiments. The recyclability of the developed SERS substrate was explored by placing the SERS substrate under UV illumination for 130 min. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ag–TiO2 NC SERS film degrades the dye molecules under UV radiation multiple times successively. Further, the Ag–TiO2 SERS substrate is highly sensitive to detect various concentrations of urea up to 1 mM covering the vital range of blood urea level. Thus, the optimised, low-cost, reusable SERS substrate can be used as level free biosensors for routine analysis of biomolecules in clinical applications.',\n",

Challenges of the management of E-waste have recently arisen out of a dearth of proper technologies to treat E-waste. Pyrolysis process can thermochemically treat waste materials that have a complicated nature and inhomogeneity. This article gives a systematic review as an effort to tackle the challenges in the context of achievements in pyrolysis process in E-waste management sector. Pyrolysis mechanism and types of pyrolysis processes and pyrolysis reactors are first discussed. Various pyrolysis technologies applied to the E-waste treatment are then summarized and compared to each other. Points to be considered for further research and pending challenges of E-waste pyrolysis are also discussed. The pyrolysis treatment of E-waste is not yet fully industrialized mostly because of high costs. However, there should be much room for further developing the E-waste pyrolysis; hence, its industrialization and commercialization is just a matter of time.',\n",

The results showed that mass concentrations contained in TSP and PM2.5 were 124±44.1 and 62.12±20.5μgm−3, respectively. The total sum of 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with TSP and PM2.5 ranged from 40.0 to 347 and 22.7 to 263ngm−3, respectively. Five-ring and six-ring PAHs accounted for 73% of total PAHs. The average concentration of benzo(a) pyrene was 2–6 times higher than in other Asian cities. Concentrations of Cr, Cu and Zn in PM2.5 of Guiyu were 4–33 times higher than in other Asian countries. In general, there were significant correlations between concentrations of individual contaminants in TSP with PM2.5 (i.e. PAHs, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn except Ni and As). The high concentrations of both PAHs and heavy metals in air of Guiyu may impose a serious environmental and health concern. Cytotoxicity of the extract of TSP and PM2.5 of ten 24h samples collected against human promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 (ATCC 1593.2) was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay. The results showed that under the same concentrations of extract, PM2.5 cytotoxicity was 2–4 times higher than TSP.',\n",

In this work, the use of particles produced from waste sericin and alginate blend crosslinked by polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether for Pd adsorption was evaluated by means of kinetic and equilibrium studies, thermodynamic parameters and characterization analyses. Sericin is a protein, present at Bombyx mori cocoons, which is discarded in the silk yarn process. Because of its chemical characteristics, the protein can form blends, as with alginate, a polysaccharide present in brown algae. The produced particles are macroporous with amorphous structure and surface area of 5.2 m2/g. In kinetics, removals above 97% were achieved from 0.5 mmol/L Pd solution (pH 2.5–3.0) with better pseudo-second order rate law fitting. The Langmuir model was better fitted to the equilibrium, but the surface has been proved to be energetically heterogeneous. External mass transfer resistance has proved to be the limiting step of adsorption. Chemisorption and physisorption are involved at metal uptake and maximum adsorbed capacities were 0.157, 0.191 and 0.249 mmol/g, at 25, 40 and 55 °C, indicating the feasibility of the adsorbent use for Pd removal/recovery.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Orange peel waste (OPW) can be an effective feedstock for extraction of natural bioactive components such as limonene, a high value-added chemical broadly exploited for food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industrial applications. Extraction of limonene from OPW has been conventionally performed via solvent extraction using hexane, a hazardous petrochemical solvent currently restricted under international regulations. In this work, we have conducted a comparative assessment of the performance of a variety of green solvents for sustainable valorisation of OPW through limonene extraction. In particular, cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), ethyl lactate (EL), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300), isopropyl acetate (IAc), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and ethyl acetate (EAc) have been evaluated as hexane replacement for the recovery of limonene from OPW. Initially, a preliminary solvent screening was carried out using the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) to estimate the solubility of limonene in the proposed solvents and rank their theoretical extraction performance. Afterwards, experimental studies were performed to determine the limonene extraction yields and optimize the operating conditions (temperature, time and solvent load) for limonene recovery from OPW using the various solvents, as confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Overall, results support that CPME and 2-MeTHF bio-based solvents significantly outperform the benchmark petrochemical solvent hexane by increasing limonene extraction yields up to 80% and 40% respectively at optimum operating conditions. Moreover, recovery and reuse of these solvents in consecutive extraction cycles was successfully accomplished, while scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM) suggests that solvent effects on biomass structure disruption could be beneficial for further bioprocessing.',\n",

However, the consumption and industrial process of citrus fruits yield a large amount of wastes, especially peels, seeds and pomace. Citrus processing wastes are normally used as animal feed or even discarded directly, which have caused serious environmental pollution and economical loss. Since citrus processing wastes contain numerous phytochemicals and bioactive components, they have good application potentials in food packaging sectors. In recent years, the development of food packaging films based on citrus processing wastes has received increasing attention. Food packaging films can be prepared by using citrus processing wastes in different forms, such as the direct use of citrus peel powder and the indirect use of active compounds extracted from the wastes (especially pectin, essential oils and seed extracts). The incorporation of citrus processing wastes or their extracts significantly alters the physical properties and enhances the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the films. The developed films have wide applications in the preservation of aquatic products, baked food, fruits, vegetables and meats. In this review, recent advances on the development of food packaging films based on citrus processing wastes are introduced. The preparation methods, physical and functional properties, and the applications of citrus processing wastes-based packaging films are summarized.',\n",

       " {'context': 'We have studied, using DFT calculations, the adsorption of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) on the pristine and doped polar ZnO (000-1)-O surfaces. The considered dopants are Cobalt and Manganese. The obtained results, before PET adsorption, show that the incorporation of Co and Mn in the ZnO surface produces oxygen passivation, a blueshift, and an important increase of magnetic moment. These facts are important to the control and development of devices in several areas such as catalysis and spintronic. For PET adsorption on pristine ZnO (000-1)-O surface is observed the formation of two hydroxyl and a carbonyl groups. Moreover, the magnetic moment of the pristine ZnO surface is zero after PET adsorption. This behavior is attributed to the reconstruction and passivation due to H atoms adsorbed on the surface. The PET adsorption produces a blueshift when it is adsorbed on pristine and doped ZnO (000-1)-O. This adsorption produces a decrease (increase) of the magnetic moment value for Co (Mn) doped surface, from 16.8 µB to 15.6 µB (6.2 µB to 16.6µB). Finally, the computed adsorption energy for both doped surfaces shows that the adsorption is energetically favorable and the process is exothermic. These values are -4.8 eV and -9.8 eV for Co and Mn-doped surfaces, respectively. Then we can conclude that PET adsorption is better in Mn-doped than Co-doped ZnO (000-1)-O.',\n",

Results from the HPSEC-UV analysis showed that composting significantly increased weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of HA with a broad range from 675 Da to 27983 Da, and governing heterogeneous chemical characteristics. In proteinaceous composts, MW< 4000 Da of HAs were greatly related to alkyl and carbonyl, while MW> 20000 Da of HAs were presented by oxygen–nitrogenous functional groups, methyl, and alkyl groups. For cellulosic composts, MW< 1500 Da and 4000–10000 Da of HAs were characterized by aliphatic ethers and aromatic groups. MW> 20000 Da of HAs were constructed by phenols, methoxy and nitrogen functional groups. In lignocellulosic composts, MW> 20000 Da of HAs were only characterized by aromatic groups. Furthermore, seven groups of HRMs adapted to the heterogeneous chemical characteristics within HAs ranked by MW were recognized. Consequently, the possible routes that composting properties response to the connections of HRMs-chemical structures-MW of HAs in proteinaceous, cellulosic and lignocellulosic composts were constructed, respectively.

       " {'context': 'Food and beverage packaging represent a relevant fraction of municipal solid waste, and its adequate management is critical. Selective waste collection by an authorized organization according to an Extended Producer Responsibility System (EPRS) is the current option implemented in Spain for packaging. Other European countries have selected an alternative or a complement: a Deposit-Refund System (DRS) for certain type of beverage packaging. The selection of an EPRS or a DRS is a complex task and this work developed a universal methodology for the evaluation of optimal waste packaging management systems, focused on food and beverage. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was applied to compare the current EPRS vs the implementation of a new system, with the coexistence of a DRS and a reduced EPRS. Although the environmental savings of the new system are superior to its impacts, even if the DRS would reach a value of 90% for the package return index, the current EPRS obtains significantly better environmental results. All impact categories are favorable to the current EPRS, except ADP, where the potentially higher DRS recycling rate is manifested. The impact associated to the flow of specific DRS packages in the new system is clearly higher than that linked to the flow of DRS excluded packages and it is even higher that the impact of the total joint flow in the current EPRS for all categories except ADP. The fundamental cause of this high impact is the backhauling stage to transport the recovered packages to the counting plants without compacting. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the preference of the current EPRS over the combination of a DRS and a reduced EPRS. The developed approach supposes a methodological advance that can be extended to previously realized studies about the implementation of waste management systems in other contexts.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Tetrachloroethene (Perchloroethylene, PCE) is an industrial chlorinated solvent and a slowly degradable compound. The degradability of PCE by Sphingopyxis ummariensis bacteria in both suspended and immobilized culture systems was investigated under aerobic conditions. For this purpose, yeast extract and glucose were used as co-substrates. Various experiments were performed on immobilized cells in a gas-recycling fixed-bed batch (GRFB) bioreactor packed with polyethylene. The results showed that PCE could be highly removed in the concentration range of 0.04–0.76 mM, but the removal occurred more efficiently in lower concentrations. It was also observed that the rate of PCE degradation decreased from 100% to 80%, and the dechlorination percentage decreased from 84 to almost 70% as the initial PCE concentration increased from 0.04 to 0.76 mM. The first-order kinetic model was best fitted to the degradation behavior in the bioreactor with kinetic rate constants in the range of 0.088–0.044 h–1. In addition, the degradation trend of an equimolar mixture of PCE and trichloroethylene (TCE) in the GRFB bioreactor showed, TCE is a competitor of PCE and its degradation rate is higher than that of PCE. The performance of the GRFB bioreactor proved that it is reliable for the aerobic removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons.',\n",

As reported by Food and Agriculture Organization the population will rise to approximately 9.3 billion in 2050 which was nearly 3 billion in 1960 and 7 billion in 2010. The high population results in increased waste generation. Energy production has been reported to the highest extent from the waste along with other value-added products. The demand of renewable resources for energy production has enhanced worldwide as most of the fossil fuels are utilized as an energy source. Nowadays, anaerobic digestion is preferred as a sustainable and an alternative method which produces bio-based fuel from waste with simultaneous management of waste in sustainable manner. In order to increase the production and quality rate of biogas there are various technologies trending in the biogas industry. Biogas utilization can be done for the production of energy in urban and rural areas. This review paper aims at the health and environmental impacts of waste which rises the need for converting the waste into different types of renewable energy sources. The state-of-the-art information provided on biological method (anaerobic digestion) for converting waste into biogas including the enhancement in the yield employing various pretreatment methods which are ignored by the researchers would generate a comprehensive literature on the subject. This paper ends with knowledge gaps and perspectives for understanding the challenges and opportunities for an effective management of waste in order to develop sustainable environment and society.',\n",

However, MW of HAs with chemical characteristics linking to HRMs in different wastes composting have never been investigated. Results from the HPSEC-UV analysis showed that composting significantly increased weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of HA with a broad range from 675 Da to 27983 Da, and governing heterogeneous chemical characteristics. In proteinaceous composts, MW< 4000 Da of HAs were greatly related to alkyl and carbonyl, while MW> 20000 Da of HAs were presented by oxygen–nitrogenous functional groups, methyl, and alkyl groups. For cellulosic composts, MW< 1500 Da and 4000–10000 Da of HAs were characterized by aliphatic ethers and aromatic groups. MW> 20000 Da of HAs were constructed by phenols, methoxy and nitrogen functional groups. In lignocellulosic composts, MW> 20000 Da of HAs were only characterized by aromatic groups. Furthermore, seven groups of HRMs adapted to the heterogeneous chemical characteristics within HAs ranked by MW were recognized. Consequently, the possible routes that composting properties response to the connections of HRMs-chemical structures-MW of HAs in proteinaceous, cellulosic and lignocellulosic composts were constructed, respectively. Our results can help to develop the fine classification-oriented approach for recycling utilization of organic wastes.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Food and beverage packaging represent a relevant fraction of municipal solid waste, and its adequate management is critical. Selective waste collection by an authorized organization according to an Extended Producer Responsibility System (EPRS) is the current option implemented in Spain for packaging. Other European countries have selected an alternative or a complement: a Deposit-Refund System (DRS) for certain type of beverage packaging. The selection of an EPRS or a DRS is a complex task and this work developed a universal methodology for the evaluation of optimal waste packaging management systems, focused on food and beverage. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was applied to compare the current EPRS vs the implementation of a new system, with the coexistence of a DRS and a reduced EPRS. Although the environmental savings of the new system are superior to its impacts, even if the DRS would reach a value of 90% for the package return index, the current EPRS obtains significantly better environmental results. All impact categories are favorable to the current EPRS, except ADP, where the potentially higher DRS recycling rate is manifested. The impact associated to the flow of specific DRS packages in the new system is clearly higher than that linked to the flow of DRS excluded packages and it is even higher that the impact of the total joint flow in the current EPRS for all categories except ADP. The fundamental cause of this high impact is the backhauling stage to transport the recovered packages to the counting plants without compacting. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the preference of the current EPRS over the combination of a DRS and a reduced EPRS. The developed approach supposes a methodological advance that can be extended to previously realized studies about the implementation of waste management systems in other contexts.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The effect of PEG dispersant on the magnetic separation of magnetite (Fe3O4) synthesized from ferrous sulfate solution via co-precipitation method with calcium hydroxide as the precipitant was investigated. The results indicated that a PEG dispersant could significantly affect Fe3O4 recovery. Adding PEG during the preparation of Fe3O4 was unfavorable for Fe3O4 recovery. When the PEG-6000 concentration was increased from 0 to 8 g/L, the iron grade and median particle size of the Fe3O4 product decreased from 65.58% and 2.35 μm to 57.79% and 1.35 μm, respectively. However, adding PEG during the wet milling of the mixed product promoted the subsequent recovery of Fe3O4. When the amount of PEG-200 increased from 0% to 4% of the powder mass, the grade of iron in the Fe3O4 product increased from 65.58% to 68.32%.

The effect of raw material quantity, compression moulding pressure and polymer loading on the properties of the composites was studied. The physico-mechanical properties of the in-house prepared composites, such as, tensile strength, tensile modulus, %elongation, flexural strength, compressive strength and water absorption are estimated as per the standard procedures. The study showed that EPS waste and biomass have a good potential to prepare the green composites. From the study, it was observed that the physico-mechanical properties of the composites increased with the increase in raw material quantity, compression moulding pressure and polymer loading. A decreased trend was observed for water absorption of the prepared composites with the increase in compression moulding pressure and polymer loading. The obtained tensile strength values of the in-house prepared composites were in the range of 4–20 MPa, whereas the estimated flexural strength values were in the range of 16–35 MPa. The obtained water absorption values were in the range of 7–18% by weight. Further in-depth study is needed to develop the wood-plastic composites with required properties based on the end application.

       " {'context': 'This study explored the conversion of plastic wastes into pavement blocks in Ghana. The physical and chemical properties of the pit sand, sea sand, plastic wastes, and pavement block were determined. The FTIR identified Quartz and Kaoline minerals as the main components of the sand samples, whereas those of the plastic wastes were polyethylene and polypropylene. The SEM showed that the plastic-pit sand pavement block (PPPB) had fibrous surface with smaller pore volume and grain size than the plastic-sea sand pavement block (PSPB). At 20% plastic composition, the water absorptivity of PPPB and PSPB maximized at 3.98% and 4.60%, respectively. Larger quantity of plastic decreased the block water absorptivity but improved the compressive strength. The maximum compressive strengths of the PPPB and PSPB were 36.96 N/mm2 and 27.81 N/mm2, respectively. The maximum tensile strength of PPPB (8.2 N/mm2) exceeded the PSPB (6.1 N/mm2). Furthermore, increasing the plastic composition improved the average penetration resistance of both pavement blocks. The results suggest that converting plastic wastes into pavement blocks is feasible, and can help reduce the rapid accumulation of plastic wastes in Ghana.',\n",

To date, there is little information available on actual value of landfilled waste namely plastic solid waste (PSW) resulting from mining operations. In this work, PSW reclaimed from an active unsanitary landfill site (MAB) has been studied with the aim of determining its thermal profile and degradation behaviour for future utilisation in thermo-chemical conversion (TCC) processes. The materials were characterised by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in accordance with internationally approved test methods in a simulated pyrolytic environment. In addition, chemical analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to study the nature of the materials reclaimed. The degradation kinetics of the reclaimed PSW were studied with the aim of determining the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the pyrolytic reactions. The Ea values determined ranged from 199 to 266 kJ mol−1 which is in-line with pyrolytic reactions applicable for future use in fuel recovery units. TGA showed a clear shift in thermograms indicating a clear change in the degradation mechanism. The physico-chemical studies conducted on the materials also favours TCC treatment over other conventional end of life options such as physical (mechanical) recycling or incineration. The degradation mechanism was also determined from the Criado method showing that Avarami-Erofeve was the model that best represents PSW degradation. Overall, this work points towards future intervention schemes for reclaimed municipal solid waste (MSW) and in particular PSW favouring TCC technologies.',\n",

A total of 366 datasets, from 1980 to 2010 and covering 14 materials, were collected from databases and reports. Totals for CO2-equivalent emissions were compared to illustrate variations in the data. It was hypothesised that emissions from material production and the recycling industry had decreased over time due to increasing regulation, energy costs and process optimisation, but the reported datasets did not reveal such a general trend. Data representing the same processes varied considerably between databases, and proper background information was hard to obtain, which in turn made it difficult to explain the large differences observed. Those differences between the highest and lowest estimated CO2 emissions (equivalents) from the primary production of newsprint, HDPE and glass were 238%, 443% and 452%, respectively. For steel and aluminium the differences were 1761% and 235%, respectively. There is a severe lack of data for some recycled materials; for example, only one dataset existed for secondary cardboard. The study shows that the choice of dataset used to represent the environmental load of a material recycling process and credited emissions from the avoided production of virgin materials is crucial for the outcome of an LCA on waste management. Great care and a high degree of transparency are mandatory, but advice on which datasets to use could not be determined from the study. However, from the gathered data, recycling in general showed lower emission of CO2 per kg material than primary production, so the recycling of materials (considered in this study) is thus beneficial in most cases.',\n",

The security of supply problem follows other problems such as energy and material scarcity, import dependency and waste generation. These problems can be alleviated via development of a low-carbon, sustainable, competitive and resource-efficient economy. One of the pillars of this approach is a circular economy and “closing the loop” approach. Integrated waste management system can close the loop, not only material-wise, through material recovery, but also energy-wise, by using energy from waste to drive whole waste management and recovery chain. Such approach is utilized in this paper through tracking of each energy vector and calculating coverage of energy needs inside the analysed systems. Energy analysis is accepted approach for sustainability assessment of the various products and systems, where primary energy consumption approach is mostly used. By combining these two approaches, the impact of closing the loop material- and energy-wise on the sustainability of the recycled materials is assessed by analysing to which degree can the embodied energy of recycled materials be reduced. The results of the analysed city case study show that energy recovery can satisfy up to 60/50% (in 2020/2030) of the total energy needs of the analysed system; in 2030 38% of waste routed to energy recovery (from which 25% to anaerobic digestion and the rest to the incinerator) satisfies around 50% of energy needs. This internal (partial) coverage of systems energy needs can additionally reduce embodied energy of recycled materials, and increase their sustainability (primarily lowered by material recovery) by 11–67% at the same time. From these results it can be concluded that energy recovery of waste could help to “close the loop” in the whole waste recovery mindset.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Nowadays, a large quantity of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) and waste compact discs (CDs) have been produced, which may cause secondary pollution and are a waste of resources. In this study, recycled glass fibers (RGF) from non-metals of WPCBs and recycled polycarbonate (RPC) from waste CDs were reused simultaneously to produce composites. A fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) was used to evaluate the functional groups in the modified RGF, the mechanical properties of composites was tested by an universal testing machine and scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the morphology and surface fractures of the composites. The result indicated that the RGF modified by a silane coupling agent-KH-550 improved the dispersion and compatibility of RGF particles in RPC matrix. The property of composite decreased significantly with resins decomposed during high temperature injection molding when nonmetals were as a filler to prepare a composite. Therefore, RGF in nonmetals was selected as a reinforcing filler of composites. The properties and the fracture surface morphology of the RGF/RPC composite were investigated. The results indicated that the appropriate addition of RGF in the composites can significantly improve the mechanical properties. The maximum tensile and flexural strength of the composites could reach up to 84.68MPa and 118.3MPa, which significantly increased by 73.52% and 30.43% respectively than those of RPC when RGF content was 40% with the particle size of 0.15–0.30mm. The properties were quite close to those of composite which was prepared with pure GF and PC.',\n",

Out of this, only 20 per cent of global E-waste is recycled each year, which means that 40 million tonnes of e-waste is placed in landfill, burned or illegally traded and treated in a sub-standard way. India is highly deficient in precious mineral resources while untreated e-waste goes to landfill, there is need for a well designed, regulated E-waste recovery and reuse methods for this has to be utilized. Electronic waste (e-waste) typically includes discarded computer monitors, motherboards, mobile phones and chargers, compact discs, headphones, television sets, air conditioners and refrigerators. With the technology development of consumer electronics, the whole world is facing serious problems caused by huge generation of E-waste produced every day. India has already become the second largest supplier of consumer electronic in the world and will become the number one in the next few years. Reuse of E-waste plastics as aggregates in some or other forms of in construction industry may be considered as economical and technically viable for solving the disposal of large amount of waste and this can be used as aggregates and fine filler in concrete or in the construction of flexible pavement. The idea was to determine whether E-waste plastic can be used an alternative to conventional material like aggregate, bitumen in a flexible pavement structures. This review work focuses on the use of E-waste plastics powder as a partial replacement for bitumen.',\n",

The hydrogenation of PET was promoted by RhOx species present on the catalyst support surface which was generated using the polyol synthesis method. As compared to the monometallic Rh catalyst, the Rh-Pt bimetallic catalyst was found to be superior for hydrogenation of PET. This superiority was attributed to the strong aromatic ring adsorption ability of Rh working in synergy with an increased H2 spillover by Pt. At a H2 pressure of 6.89 MPa and 50 °C for 60 min, complete hydrogenation of PET to PECHD was achieved over the Rh-Pt bimetallic catalyst possessing theoretical Rh and Pt metal loadings of 2.5 wt% each.

The liquid product components were quantified by flame ionization detector-gas chromatography. Six kinds of catalysts were used for catalytic pyrolysis, including commercial SiO2-Al2O3, Pd on alumina, Cu, Ni, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. Pd on alumina, Cu, Ni and Fe3O4 had no catalytic activity. The product components were almost the same as those produced by thermal pyrolysis with no catalyst. Al2O3-SiO2 products had a large amount of low-carbon-number components.

The increasing awareness about the environment has tremendously contributed to the concerns related with disposal of the generated wastes. Solid waste management is one of the major environmental concerns in the world. With the scarcity of space for landfilling and due to its ever increasing cost, waste utilization has become an attractive alternative to disposal. Research is being carried out on the utilization of waste products in concrete. Such waste products include discarded tires, plastic, glass, steel, burnt foundry sand, and coal combustion by-products (CCBs). Each of these waste products has provided a specific effect on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The use of waste products in concrete not only makes it economical, but also helps in reducing disposal problems. Reuse of bulky wastes is considered the best environmental alternative for solving the problem of disposal. One such waste is plastic, which could be used in various applications. However, efforts have also been made to explore its use in concrete/asphalt concrete. The development of new construction materials using recycled plastics is important to both the construction and the plastic recycling industries. This paper presents a detailed review about waste and recycled plastics, waste management options, and research published on the effect of recycled plastic on the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. The effect of recycled and waste plastic on bulk density, air content, workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, impact resistance, permeability, and abrasion resistance is discussed in this paper.',\n",

The maximum decomposition temperature of polyethylene terephthalate on the catalytic thermogravimetric analysis over HZSM-5 (452\\u202f°C) was reduced by co-feeding with yellow poplar wood to 444\\u202f°C because of its catalytic property and the effective interaction between the catalytic co-pyrolysis intermediates of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Non-catalytic co-pyrolysis produced smaller amounts of large molecular polyethylene terephthalate pyrolyzates because of the more effective secondary cracking and deoxygenation. Calcium oxide was effective in the deacidification and acid zeolites were efficient in aromatics production during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Among the acid zeolites, HZSM-5 showed the highest efficiency on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEXs) production, followed by Hβ and HY because of its strong acidity and proper pore size. The experimental MS intensities of BTEXs obtained from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over HZSM-5 (1083\\u202f×\\u202f106) were larger than their theoretical value (998\\u202f×\\u202f106).

In this study, the degradation of the four main plastics (Nylon, Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) found in the sea was observed for 6.5\\u202fmonths as they were exposed to UV irradiation in a marine environment. Data on changes in the physical and chemical properties of each of them were collected in order to evaluate the possibilities of material (mechanical) recycling. A thermobalance was used to look for differences in the thermal decomposition of the plastics during this time. In addition, the mechanical properties of each plastic were studied. Results showed that both thermal and mechanical properties were affected, causing a weakening of the material which became less elastic and more rigid. Furthermore, SEM and AFM images were obtained: they showed cracks, flakes and granular oxidation as well as a loss of homogeneity on the surface of the samples. These changes make mechanical recycling unfeasible, since the quality of the recycled material is insufficient to ensure a high virgin material substitution rate.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The recycling of plastic is carried out under serious constraints in Brazil, the main ones being the lack of both fiscal incentives and selective garbage separation (curbside collection). These difficulties were investigated in the Metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, where the large Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro is located. The ways of disposition and recycling pointed out at Rio de Janeiro can be used as a base of information for other Brazilian cities. The objective is to show how the plastic recycling is been carried out to indicate its own difficulty. Besides this studied subject, it was evaluated the current capacity for the recycling of post-consumed plastic. The study was based on field research with visits to plastic recyclers, dealers, recycling cooperatives sorting plants, selective garbage programs and urban waste dumps. The plastic recycling capacity of the recycling companies located in the Metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, which were studied, corresponded to 8% in 2003 and 16% in 2007 of all the plastic deposited in the main dump of Rio de Janeiro City. Most materials which are recycled come from dumps or controlled dumps, where garbage pickers collect them and send them, mainly, to dealers. The dealers then take the postconsumer plastic to recycling industry, where this material is usually transformed into artifacts with low aggregated value. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polyolefins are the plastics most recycled in Rio de Janeiro.',\n",

       " {'context': 'To enhance the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of engineered geopolymer composites (EGC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres in EGC can be partially replaced with recycled tyre polymer (RTP) fibres. This paper presents a systematic experimental study on the effects of PVA fibre volume fraction (1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%) and RTP fibre content (0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0%) on the dynamic compressive behaviour of EGC under various strain rates (54.43–164.13 s−1). Results indicate that the flowability, quasi-static compressive strength and elastic modulus of EGC reduce with the increase of PVA fibre content, where the reductions can be effectively mitigated by adding RTP fibres. The dynamic compressive properties of all investigated mixtures including dynamic compressive strength, dynamic increase factor (DIF) and energy absorption capacity show a pronounced strain rate dependency which can be well described using the proposed equations for DIF against strain rate ranging from 10−5 s−1 to 103 s−1 with R 2 values of mostly greater than 0.9. The dynamic compressive properties of EGC are enhanced with the increasing PVA fibre dosage under various strain rates while replacing PVA fibre with a certain amount of RTP fibre (0.25% and 0.5%) can result in better dynamic compressive properties compared to EGC with 2.0% PVA fibre. EGC containing 1.75% PVA fibre and 0.25% RTP fibre can be considered as the optimal mixture given its superior quasi-static and dynamic compressive properties in comparison with EGC with 2.0% PVA fibre.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has been significantly increasing because RO technology is a great option for the production of clean water for both domestic and industrial purposes, among water stress conditions and scarce clean water resources. The main solid waste from RO plants is membrane elements, which are often disposed of in landfills, and the large amount of waste needs to be properly managed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the environmental and economic gains of implementing end-of-life RO membrane recycling. The method applied the Material Input per Service Unit (MIPS) eco-efficiency tool. The recycling technique was based on chemical oxidation of thin-film-composite (TFC) RO membranes and was applied by immersion in a commercial sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). The recycled membrane showed similar performance and characteristics to porous membranes. Based on current market costs, the replacement of a new ultrafiltration membrane spiral element (with an average lifespan of 5 years) by the recycled membrane (with an estimated lifespan of 2 years) for water treatment results in monetary savings of 98.9%. MIPS indicated that chemical conversion of one 8-inch spiral element of an end-of-life RO membrane with 13.5\\u202fkg results in 2609.81\\u202fkg of materials not being polluted or withdrawn from the environment. The most important conclusion of this study is the possibility to have economic gains, associated with environmental benefits, arising from the use of recycled membranes.',\n",

The process of dumping plastic waste is a huge problem and also harmful to the environment. Plastic products are one of the major sources of pollution for land and water. Dumping of plastic waste is a critical problem. To overcome these effects, solid waste management can be used in the construction area. By placing the cement with Prospis Juliflora ash the side effects caused by cement can be reduced. Solid waste such as crushed plastic and Prosopis Juliflora Ash (PJA) can be used in concrete production. Prosopis Juliflora, a persistent weed that has spread widely over the past 150 years, has been an environmental issue in various parts of the world, including India. Because of its environmental and economic effects, in Africa and India, Prosopis Juliflora has been confirmed as a deleterious plant. It can fix large quantities of carbon dioxide as biomass from the atmosphere, it can be viewed as a smart source of biomass. By replacing the cement with Prosopis Juliflora Ash the side effects of cement towards the environment can also reduce. In this research, the white cement, plastic, and PJA are used to make a floor tile. The primary binder cement is replaced in this study by plastic waste and PJA with 10%, 20% and 30% proportion. In this study, mechanical properties of concrete with and without addition of PJA is studied as per Indian Standard code provisions. It has been observed that these combinations prove good for abrasion and impact resistance of floor tiles made from these, but do not contribute much to strength gain.',\n",

To address this knowledge gap, this study quantifies the food packaging generation from major supermarket and convenience store chains in Taipei, Taiwan. We focus on the composition, recycling habit, and the recycling status to evaluate the packaging recyclability and major pathways for material losses. Based on our field survey and analysis, the total amount of plastic packaging generation was 21846.04 tons in 2020 with 64.99% of it being recycled. We defined the recycling rates as the continued product of Recyclable Content Ratio of the packaging itself, Sorting Accuracy Ratio of consumers, and Re-granulated Ratio in the final treatment facilities. These three ratios for major food categories were also presented to identify the hotspots of material losses. Our results suggest that to promote plastic food packaging recycling, identifying the limitations in different stages and designing corresponding strategies is crucial.',\n",

Four recycling cases, including mechanical recycling, semi-mechanical recycling, back-to-oligomer recycling and back-to-monomer recycling were analysed. Three allocation methods are applied for open-loop recycling, i.e. the “cut-off” approach, the “waste valuation” approach and the “system expansion” approach. Nine environmental impact indicators were analysed, i.e. non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. The LCA results are compared with virgin PET fibre and other commodity fibre products, i.e. cotton, viscose, PP (polypropylene) and PLA (polylactic acid). The LCA results show that recycled PET fibres offer important environmental benefits over virgin PET fibre. Depending on the allocation methods applied for open-loop-recycling, NREU savings of 40–85% and GWP savings of 25–75% can be achieved. Recycled PET fibres produced by mechanical recycling cause lower environmental impacts than virgin PET in at least eight out of a total of nine categories. Recycled fibres produced from chemical recycling allow to reduce impacts in six to seven out of a total of nine categories compared to virgin PET fibres. Note that while mechanical recycling has a better environmental profile than chemical recycling, chemically recycled fibres can be applied in a wider range of applications than mechanically recycled fibres.',\n",

This alarming situation demands sustainable energy resources and approaches to deal with these environmental hazards and power deficit. Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis address both energy and environmental issues caused by civilization and industrialization. The processes use hazardous waste materials including waste tires, plastic and medical waste, and biomass waste such as livestock waste and agricultural waste as feedstock to produce gas, char and pyrolysis oil for energy production. Usage of hazardous materials as pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis feedstock reduces disposal of harmful substances into environment, reducing occurrence of soil and water pollution, and substituting the non-renewable feedstock, fossil fuels. As compared to combustion, pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis have less emission of air pollutants and act as alternative options to landfill disposal and incineration for hazardous materials and biomass waste. Hence, stabilizing heavy metals and solving the energy and waste management problems. This review discusses the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biomass and harmful wastes to strive towards circular economy and eco-friendly, cleaner energy with minimum waste disposal, reducing negative impact on the planet and creating future possibilities.',\n",

The natural bacterial carbon storage polymer, PHAs, are considered an interesting answer to this because of their marine biodegradability, ability to be made from a variety of waste resources, and the advantageous physical properties they can present in the form of advanced medium-chain length (MCL) copolymers. However, there has been a relative dearth of research effort and literature review with regard to the combination of these last two aspects – production of advanced MCL-PHA copolymers from waste resources.

       " {'context': 'The challenge for a circular plastics economy transition is to focus policies on key leverage points that initiate actual system transitions. This requires a systemic perspective on the plastics industries. This study takes such a systemic perspective by employing a network approach to examine the often-underestimated complexity of interrelating markets in a circular plastics economy, and their structural sensitivity to governance interventions. Based on the case of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) markets in Germany, we investigate the structures and underlying dynamics of increasing circularity in the PET industry. Concerns about plastic litter accumulating in the natural environment have facilitated the development of niche markets for the recycling of plastic litter recovered from the environment. We systematically reveal that recycling markets connecting diverse waste sources with a broad range of new applications are key areas of intervention in the structural transitions towards circular industries. By connecting otherwise disconnected parts of the system, the recycling of recovered plastic litter is a key leverage point for the circular economy transition. We recommend to focus governance efforts on such key leverage markets as powerful venues to initiate systemic change.',\n",

However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring environmental and human health protection, at all times.',\n",

The results showed that PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed higher H2-enriched gaseous product yields (>40 wt%), but higher H2 concentration (over 70 vol%) was obtained from the gaseous products of HIPS and GPPS. In terms of liquid oil, the yield exhibited a relatively stable tendency, which was ~ 20 wt%, and the liquid product comprised hydrocarbons with a carbon number range mainly between 8 and 16. For solid carbon deposits, HIPS waste plastic led to a higher solid deposit yield of 49.4 wt%, followed by GPPS of 48.7 wt%. By contrast, PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed lower yields of 30.2 wt%, 36.9 wt%, and 35.9 wt%, respectively. In summary, more, purer and cleaner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be obtained from pyrolysis–catalysis of polyolefin (PP and PE), while more amorphous carbon and hydrogen were gathered from PS.',\n",

Fuel properties of typical CISW components including paper (PP), plastic (PL), textile (TX), and rubber (RB), and their mixtures were characterized by proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, and caloric value determination. Five formulas involving Channiwala and Parikh-formula, Dulong-formula, Steuere-formula, Scheuere-Kestner-formula, and Li-formula was used to predict higher heating value (HHV) of individual and mixed CISW. The corresponding pyrolysis behavior were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in N2 atmosphere at heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 °C/min, respectively. The obtained results indicated that proximate analysis of CISW mixtures can be predicted by typical component based on the mass-weighted method. HHV prediction errors by Channiwala and Parikh-formula, Dulong-formula and Steuere-formula for typical components (PP, PL and TX) and their CISW mixtures are less than 10%, which can be used as a low-cost alternative for calorific value prediction of CISW. Pyrolysis characteristics of the mixed CISW can be predicted by the mass-weighted method when the RB component in the mixed CISW is less than 25%. A 3-pseudo-component model is suitable for predicting kinetic behavior of pyrolysis of individual and mixed CISW. The overall synergistic effect of individual component (except RB) during pyrolysis of mixed CISW is insignificant.',\n",

Mechanical properties of the resulting bio-foams were improved, and the bio-foams exhibit inherent low density, sufficient water stability, excellent natural degradability (93% degradation in 85 days), and good cost-efficiency.

In this study, co-pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (i.e. corn stover) and wood wastes (i.e. narra, Pterocarpus indicus and ipil, Intsia bijuga) with polyolefin plastics (i.e. polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene) were examined via thermogravimetric analyses. Unlike previous co-pyrolysis studies which had focused on the improvement of product yield or cumulative weight loss, herein, we present the synergistic effects on the mass decomposition rate or rate of generation of products during co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of temperature, and biomass-to-plastic ratio on rate synergy during co-pyrolysis. Rate synergy values up to 10% per min were obtained for biomass and plastic blends. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reactions in the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated using the Coats-Redfern method. Activation energies for agricultural waste and plastics blends ranged from 45 to 82 kJ mol−1 while that for wood wastes and plastic blends ranged from 53 to 112 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of plastic was found to be lower during co-pyrolysis with biomass than in pure form. Moreover, biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis followed a two-stage degradation: biomass degradation from 200 to 400 °C and thereafter plastic degradation from 400 to 500 °C. Overall, the use of lignocellulosic biomass and waste plastics for biofuel production can also minimize the volume of solid wastes for landfills.',\n",

The experiments were conducted in a 2.5-L stirring reactor temperature variation (150, 175, 200 and 225\\u202f°C) with several holding times and solid loads. The result showed that wet torrefaction at a temperature of 200\\u202f°C with holding time of 30\\u202fmin and solid load of 1:2.5 was the optimum condition, producing solid product with uniform physical shape, small particles and homogeneous particle size distribution, HHV of 33.01\\u202fMJ/kg and energy yield of 89%.

Several industrial sorting technologies exist, and others are in development. However, each of them has drawbacks.

MIR-HSI (Mid-Infrared) could be a suitable and viable alternative to resolve this issue. Hence, this work, based on laboratory FTIR-ATR (Fourier-Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflection), focuses on possible sources of spectral alteration, which could impair identification of usual polymers using industrial MIR-HSI. It aims to help simple and rapid laboratory characterization and give tools to avoid misidentification or enable specific segregation during industrial sorting. First, acquisition parameters were degraded to simulate those imposed by industrial conditions: short acquisition time, diminished resolution and blank defaults. Then, impact on formulations of usual WEEE (Waste of Electric and Electrical Equipment) plastics were evaluated, with PE, PP, ABS and HIPS as matrices, and carbon black (at different concentrations), calcite, talc, titanium oxide and some flame retardants as additives.

In this work, we provide a new strategy for the crosslinking of PS based on the nitrogen-coordinating cyclic boronic ester (NCB) linkages. PS vitrimers are synthesized from PS with hydroxyl groups and isocyanate-terminated NCB oligomer. Incorporating NCB linkages cangreatly improve the solvent resistance, thermal stability and mechanical properties of PS without sacrificing its dielectric properties. PS vitrimers exhibit rapid stress relaxation and improved creep resistance due to the stable NCB linkages. PS vitrimers were able to withstand multiple reprocessing cycles via the exchange reactions of NCB linkages without catalyst. The recycled PS vitrimers were shown to regain the structural integrity, mechanical strength and dielectric properties as the original. The glass fibre reinforced PS vitrimer composites were prepared to explore the application in copper clad manufacture, which showed good mechanical properties and can be conveniently recycled to resin solution and clean glass fibre. This work provides a new strategy for the development of the green dielectric polymer materials for copper clad laminates, and may serve as a guide for rational design of dynamic materials based on general-purpose plastics.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The wind power industry is a fast growing, global consumer of glass fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRP) composites, which correlates with the industry’s rapid growth in recent years. Considering current and future developments, GFRP waste amounts from the wind industry are expected to increase. Therefore, a sustainable process is needed for dealing with wind turbines at the end of their service life in order to maximize the environmental benefits of wind power. Most components of a wind turbine such as the foundation, tower, gear box and generator are already recyclable and treated accordingly. Nevertheless, wind turbine blades represent a challenge due to the type of materials used and their complex composition. There are a number of ways to treat GFRP waste, depending on the intended application. The best available waste treatment technologies in Europe are outlined in this paper. However, there is a lack of practical experiences in applying secondary materials in new products. A Danish innovation consortium was addressing this waste with a predominant focus on the blades from the wind power industry. The outcomes from the consortium and the various tested tools are presented in this paper as well as the secondary applications that were proposed. The outcomes are structured using Ellen MacArthur’s circular economy diagram. The “adjusted” diagram illustrates the potentials for a continuous flow of composite materials through the value circle, where secondary applications were developed in respect to “reuse”, “resize and reshape”, “recycle”, “recover” and ‘conversion’. This included applications for architectural purposes, consumer goods, and industrial filler material. By presenting the outcomes of the consortium, new insights are provided into potential forms of reuse of composites and the practical challenges that need to be addressed.',\n",

Dealkalization is prerequisite and basis for the complete utilization of RM. Mn-containing leachate is a weakly acidic wastewater generated during the storage of manganese sulfate residue. In the current study, Mn-containing leachate was used to investigate the multistage dealkalization behavior of RM. The results showed that Mn-containing leachate effectively lowered pH levels from 11.82 to 7.61 and the leaching efficiency of Na and K reached 80% and 73%, respectively, under the conditions of five-stage leaching with reaction temperature of 95 °C, reaction time of 2.0 h, and a liquid-solid ratio of 10 mL/g. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis results suggested that the content of sodium oxide was reduced from 4.97% to 0.78% while the contents of SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 were essentially unchanged. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that hydroxycancrinite in RM was dissolved accompanying sodium released and Mn(II) appeared in the newly-generated form of charmatite in the dealkalized RM. The final dealkalized RM product was demonstrated to be with low soluble heavy metals from its water leaching test. This research provides a sustainable reference of disposal waste with waste for the dealkalization of RM, and the findings of this work demonstrate a new mechanism of replacement Na with Mn in RM dealkalization process.',\n",

A massive amount of non-renewable materials and industrial products like aggregates, bitumen, cement, lime, and other additives are consumed during construction and maintenance of this pavement system. Extraction and production of these virgin materials is an unsustainable practice. Wastage of materials, environmental deterioration, depletion of resources, and the spike in material cost led researchers to search for alternative materials that can be used in flexible pavement. This paper provides an overview of such recycled materials that have been successfully used in different layers of flexible pavements. Studies have established that the use of secondary material not only provide an efficient waste disposal technique but also reduce demand for conventional material and reduce overall construction cost. Through this paper, an attempt has also been made to identify the reason because of which, despite having essential studies, their field implementation has been limited and suggest possible remedies by which use of recycled material in the flexible pavement can be promoted.',\n",

These systems selectively extrude/deposit polymers to manufacture parts directly from computational designs. Therefore, FDM enables conversion of recycled thermoplastic polymers to higher quality products. However, FDM induces porosity, which reduces mechanical performance and causes variations in mechanical properties of fused deposition modeled (FDMed) polymers. A safe and reliable use of FDMed-recycled polymers demands a better understanding of the effect of recycling on the mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of three rounds of recycling on the stochastic mechanical properties of FDMed ABS. A total of 337 tensile tests were performed on FDMed virgin and recycled ABS. Recycling increased the porosity of FDMed ABS from ∼11 vol% to ∼17 vol %. The tensile and fracture strength decreased by ∼10%. The strain at break decreased by 25% from 5.2% to 3.9%, causing a decrease in toughness by 37%. We observed significant variations in the mechanical properties, which were analyzed using Weibull statistics. An S-type deviation from Weibull distribution was observed for strength variations that was related to porosity. Minimal degradation in ABS molecular structure was observed via gel permeation chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an increase in elemental iron with recycling.',\n",

Large deficits in the digitalization of mechanical waste treatment plants (smart waste factory) offer great potential for improvement. Real-time material flow monitoring is carried out in very few plants, thus wasting considerable potential for improving plant performance. This article describes results from the authors’ own practical analyses using sensor-based technologies for monitoring material flows, an on-site investigation in a large waste treatment plant and also in a pilot-scale plant (Technical Line 4.0) using mixed commercial waste (MCW) from Austria. The obtained data shows that the quantitative monitoring of volume and mass flow (via laser triangulation as well as near-infrared (NIR) based monitoring) and material composition (NIR sensor) is possible. The observed fluctuations were categorised in short-, mid- and long-term fluctuations and were led back to their causes, i.e. discontinuous feeding process, material and machine-specific characteristics. Using the quotient of the 90% (Q90) and 10% (Q10) quantiles of time-resolved volume-flow data for the assessment of fluctuations, for the considered time-intervals, resulted in Q90 / Q10 ratios between 3.39 and 4.58. If short-term fluctuations (within the observed time-intervals) are related to the 29.6 s moving average, deviations between 1.8% and 6.8% result. To verify the relevance of such fluctuations, sensor-based sorting (SBS) experiments were conducted, revealing a reduced product purity of 6% due to short-term fluctuations in the feed of the SBS-Machine using light packaging waste (LPW).',\n",

In the absence of biochar, up to 53 wt% of wax was observed at 550 ºC, whereas at the biochar/mask ratio of 2, around 41 wt% of liquid oil was produced without the formation of wax. The hydrogen content in the gas stream was about 26 vol% at 600 ºC for non-catalytic pyrolysis, which increased to around 55 vol% at the expense of light hydrocarbons such as methane and C2–4 for the catalytic process with the biochar/mask ratio of 3. In resulting liquid oil, the content of mono-aromatics, especially toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene was about 55% for catalytic runs, which was far greater than that of 38% from the non-catalytic run. Interestingly, the dyes released from mask pyrolysis could be completely captured/adsorbed by biochar, leading to a much cleaner oil. After 10 cycles of reuse at 600 ºC without regeneration, the biochar still held a good selectivity toward hydrogen and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons. This study exemplified a readily accessible concept and pathway of ‘waste against waste’ targeted to upcycle waste disposable masks over biochar from biomass waste.',\n",

This has put a burden on landfilling, which is the major waste disposal method. Waste reduction, re-use and recycling opportunities exist but are not fully utilized. The common items that are re-used and re-cycled are plastics, paper, aluminum, glass, steel, cardboard, and yard waste. This paper develops an overview of reverse logistics at Kiteezi landfill, the only officially recognised waste disposal facility for Kampala City. The paper analyses, in details the collection, re-processing, re-distribution and final markets of these products into a reversed supply chain network. Only 14% of the products at Kiteezi landfill are channeled into the reverse chain while 63% could be included in the distribution chain but are left out and disposed of while the remaining 23% is buried. This is because of the low processing power available, lack of market value, lack of knowledge and limited value addition activities to the products. This paper proposes possible strategies of efficient and effective reverse logistics development, applicable to Kampala City and other similar cities.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The tri-pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE ), cornstalk (CS ) and anthracite coal (AC ) was performed using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The pyrolysis and kinetic characteristics of the raw feed materials (PE, CS and AC ) along with selected mass blend ratios was investigated and compared. The tri-pyrolysis process for the selected mass blend ratios is characterised by three distinct stages, which is sequentially dominated by cornstalk CS , polyethylene PE , and anthracite AC . It was found that the activation energies representing the tri-pyrolysis process are different with respect to the activation energies associated with the individual raw feed materials. It is observed that for any given fixed mass blend ratio of PE as the contribution of CS is increased the initial decomposition temperature at which tri-pyrolysis takes place is significantly lowered to <190\\u202f°C. Therefore, the increased addition of CS is considered to enhance the tri-pyrolysis process. An increase in the mass blend ratio of AC resulted in higher yields of pyrolysed residue. The yield of tri-pyrolysed residue accounted for up to 40\\u202fwt% when the mass blend contribution of AC was ≥0.5. Activation energies of <130\\u202fkJ\\u202fmol−1 for the suite of mass blended materials was determined with little variation in the actual EA’s between the respective mass blend ratios. The tri-pyrolysis reaction is thought to be more stable than the pyrolysis of the individual raw feed materials and it is further suggested that a synergy between the respective feed materials exists during the tri-pyrolysis process.',\n",

Compression and three point bending tests were carried out on the composites at temperatures of −20, 25, 40, 60 and 80°C. In addition, to estimate the pseudo-cohesive strength between fine particles forming the structure of composites studied, the corresponding compression tests were numerically modeled. The obtained results show that the composites studied have the highest mechanical strength and pseudo-cohesive strength at the temperature of 25°C. Also, by increasing the weight percent of particles up to 10%, the strength of composites increases and beyond that (i.e. 20% and 40% sand) it decreases.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Public policies can leverage the recycling of materials. However, there is no clear guidance on how to use such policies and still spare public funds. To fill this gap, a multiple-case study was undertaken in Brazil. Eleven companies that can produce new products using the waste generated by their customers were investigated. The findings contribute by suggesting how governments can economically use taxes, sanctions, incentives and other public instruments to induce recycling. Tax exemptions are not required when the waste recycled reduces the manufacturer's costs or generates revenue for customers who produce it and/or for the scrap dealers who collect it. Sanctions or penalties imposed on the manufacturer's customers can increase the recycling efforts of such manufacturers when the recycling is technically feasible but not economically attractive. Sanctions are ineffective when wastes have a good market value or are widespread over millions of generation points. For such cases, the public policies should focus on community awareness campaigns and attention on waste pickers. Incentives for the technological development can be provided to wastes that present a good market value but do not have an economical recycling technology available. Granting resources to universities and technological institutes will help spread the solution to SME companies. By better understanding how to apply public instruments, the governments will be able to save funds on tax exemptions, better define sanctions, focus its community awareness campaigns, focus its waste pickers support, and better allocate funds to support the development of new recycling technologies.\",\n",

       " {'context': '               Environmental pollution from plastic waste and the energy crisis are currently among the main burning issues. Thermal or catalytic recycling of waste plastic for liquid fuel generation is the most promising solution to these issues. Catalytic cracking is usually preferred over thermal one owing to its greater selectivity towards the desired products. This chapter describes the properties and potential of polyoxometalates (POMs) as catalysts for catalytic cracking of plastic waste and converting it into derived fuel oil. POMs are distinct metal oxide condensates with unique physicochemical properties that make them excellent candidates for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis applications. POM-based catalytic cracking shows high selectivity for liquid hydrocarbons due to a larger number of Brönsted acid sites that accelerate the cracking process, thereby breaking the larger hydrocarbons into smaller ones and as a result, large amounts of petrol like fractions and gaseous products are obtained. Both oil and gas fractions obtained by catalytic pyrolysis are valued fuel products. This chapter is explicitly focusing on the catalytic properties of POMs and describing the reaction mechanism for POM-based cracking reactions as well as highlighting the effect of POMs on the products’ distribution and selectivity.

Most of the E-plastics are not recycled as the presence of toxic additives (e.g. heavy metals, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), antimony, etc.) have associated environmental and health concerns. However, the majority of the studies are focused on quantitative assessment of the toxic constituents in E-plastics, while empirical information regarding the potential toxic effects in humans is largely lacking. To gain a deeper appreciation into the toxicological profile of E-plastics, in situ time-dependent exposures of 6 different human cell lines to a panel of 8 representative E-plastics recovered from liquid crystal displays (LCD), keyboards, screen frames, and wire insulators were conducted. Although several hazardous elements (e.g. Pb, As, Sb, Zn, Cu, etc) were detected at concentrations that far exceed the limit values permitted by the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive and EU Directives in the panel E-plastics, in-depth analysis of the 144 unique cell viability data points and live-dead staining experiments suggest that the acute and sub-chronic toxic effects of E-plastics in direct contact with human cells are negligible. These observations agreed with the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry data, which revealed that leaching of these toxic additives into the biological milieu is not sufficiently high to trigger a cytotoxic response up to a continuous culture period of 2 weeks. The novel insights gained from this study are posited to further clarify the uncertainty associated with the safety and circular economy implementation of E-plastics.',\n",

On the one side, the use of scrap polymeric materials instead of virgin ones helps ease the pressure on landfills and reduces the demand for extraction from nature. On the other side, waste materials are often composed of high-tech polymers that can consistently improve materials’\\xa0performance and reduce overall costs. A multitude of benefits on both the environment and bitumen performance can be achieved by using correctly waste plastics as pavement material.

       " {'context': 'Waste management regarding discarded cathode ray tube (CRT) funnels glass has become a major concern worldwide due to its potential toxicological threat on the environment and surrounding population health. Conventional recycling process of CRT funnel glass waste typically involved a method of crushing and reutilization as fine aggregates for concrete works. However, this approach has been facing serious repercussions in terms of lead (Pb) leaching and concrete expansion due to the accompanying alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Hence, this study investigates the potential of exploiting alternative recycling method which incorporate the technique of melting and annealing in producing spherical CRT funnel glass (GS). CRT concrete containing GS and crushed CRT funnel glass (GC) as coarse aggregates in various ratios were tested for its properties concerning; workability, voids, mechanical strength, water absorption, drying shrinkage, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), leaching of Pb, and microstructure. Findings from this study had discovered the utilization of GS to have decreased the Pb leaching rate (0.516 mg/L) and ASR expansion (0.035%), which may be attributed to the minimal formation of micro-cracks as evidenced in the scanning of electron micrograph. Despite its strength reducing properties, combination of GS and GC at a specified ratio of 0.6:0.4 was found capable to achieve the highest CRT concrete strength of 64 MPa, only 12% lower than the control concrete specimen. Essentially, this research findings underpin the opportunities in the exploitation of recycling the CRT funnel glass as aggregate in the form of melted-spherical glass.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Technological innovation has the promise to catalyze reduced environmental impacts through higher energy efficiency, product design that promotes reuse, and use of benign materials. However, as new technologies emerge, it is easy to lose sight of the environmental burden associated with technology transition and premature replacement of technology. Though product turnover can lead to gains in energy efficiency, it also can contribute to the creation of expanded and diversified waste streams. The market for residential lighting products continues to rapidly evolve, with new LED products emerging each year. Technology change in the lighting industry has unintended consequences, including new waste streams associated with the obsolete products. This paper examines the waste burden that occurs as a consequence of technology change when lighting products are replaced or upgraded. To understand the impact of residential lighting replacement, the authors used life cycle assessment to evaluate LED products. We defined three personas representing various typical technology adopters within the product adoption curve to quantify the volume and change rate of lighting products. The personas have also been used to estimate the waste impact for larger populations, and the results show that while an innovator’s waste burden is lowest amongst the three personas, a non-trivial waste burden accompanies the transition to LED lighting products for all three personas. The results quantify the waste burden of high performance lighting and further motivate the development and implementation of recycling programs and policies to prevent waste diverted to landfills by consumers. The results also confirm that attention must be paid to how to reduce the waste burden of LED lighting products through improved design and lighting as a service models.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper reviews the latest research findings on the combined treatment of both electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) and halogenated plastic wastes, mainly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame-retardants (BFRs). EAFD contains heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Fe, Cd, etc.); its disposal using the traditional landfilling method threatens the environment. On the other hand, halogenated plastic wastes accumulate annually at an alarming rate due to their excessive production, consumption, and disposal. PVC, for example, does not decompose naturally; it remains one of the most dangerous plastics, as it contains high proportions of chlorine that is responsible for hazardous emissions of chlorinated organic compounds (dioxins) and hydrochloric acid vapour. Recent research have focused on the combined treatment of PVC/BFRs and EAFD. HCl/HBr acids produced from the pyrolysis of PVC/BFRs can react with the metal oxides in the EAFD to convert them into readily separable metal halides. Alternatively, several researches illustrated the advantages of using additives such as metal oxides during the incineration treatment of waste PVC/BFRs to fix gaseous HCl/HBr, and consequently, EAFD would be considered an excellent and cheap candidate for PVC dechlorination, as well as dehalogenation of other halogenated plastics during thermal recycling processes. In this review we critically discuss literature findings on thermal treatment of PVC/BFR materials under oxidative and pyrolytic environments, typically at temperatures of 200–900 °C in presence of metal oxides or EAFD. We also discuss the treatment/disposal routes for both waste materials (EAFD and halogenated plastic wastes) and the environmental impact of these disposal options. The review, finally, proposes the research necessary to minimize the hazards of these waste materials; Several future research areas were identified including the need to study the behaviour of real EAFD-plastic waste mixtures under oxidative thermal conditions with focus on both the selective recovery of metals and identification, quantification, and minimization of halogenated organic compounds released during the combined thermal treatment.',\n",

The process is essential when it comes to recycling multilayer plastic parts such as flexible food packaging. However, this recycling method generates a multiphase material whose interfaces must be stabilized so that it can be recovered. The nature of polymeric materials as well as their composition in flexible food packaging allows to achieve this, only if a chemical reaction is developed during the mixing stage (in-situ reaction). This work was the opportunity to demonstrate the potential of this strategy from model mixtures consisting of Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE)/ Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and a commercial tie polymer called OREVAC. The latter is a linear low-density polyethylene-graft-maleic anhydride. In this work, two types of OREVAC were used (OR-PE 1 and OR-PE 2) as compatibilizers. The rheological and morphological results show the effect of the added compatibilizer, and the limited efficiency obtained due to the low quantity which has been used in the blends.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Adding nanoparticles to a host polymer can lead to performance improvements that can be twice as beneficial to the environment: first, sustainable nanocomposites based on bioplastics or recycled plastics could replace ubiquitous petroleum-based polymers; second, substantial plastic saving could be achieved by profiting from the superior specific properties of the nanocomposites. Nevertheless, the inherent environmental burden of nanoparticles can compromise the expected benefits. Here we address the controversial issue of the environmental sustainability of “green” polymer nanocomposites based on bioplastics and recycled plastics. A critical review of life-cycle assessment studies regarding nanocomposites and their individual constituents is presented. Nanoparticles have a remarkable environmental impact despite their typically low content. Except for organo-clays and graphene, the production of common nanofillers (nanocellulose, titanium dioxide, silver and, above all, carbon nanotubes) emits relevant amounts of greenhouse gases and requires high energy, nullifying the advantages of using green polymer matrices. Reaching high performance becomes hence crucial to make polymer nanocomposites truly sustainable through material saving. For this purpose, increasing the content of nanoparticles or functionalizing them to enhance their dispersion in the host polymer can unexpectedly entail environmental benefits.',\n",

These wastes generated from domestic, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities. Several methods are used for the waste management but still huge quantities of organic wastes remain unattended which is a cause of concern. Therefore, scientific and sustainable interventions are needed for the management of organic wastes. Vermicomposting is one such technique which is economically viable and has manifold advantages over other non-scientific waste disposal techniques. Vermicomposting has been well addressed in recent years and several researchers have investigated the effectiveness of vermitechnology to treat organic wastes. Although organic wastes are heterogeneous in nature but its biodegradable nature offers an immense opportunity for vermicomposting. Combined action of earthworm and microbes mineralize organic waste and transformed it into manure that has potential to solve several soil fertility and pollution related issues. Vermicomposting can also potentially be used as a bioremediation technique. Use of vermicomposting for waste treatment and bioremediation on one hand ensure agricultural and environmental sustainability and on the other hand manure is provided. Earthworms, a product of vermicomposting, can be used as feed in aquaculture and poultry industry.            ',\n",

Expanded polystyrene waste, massively produced worldwide, is presented in this work as a novel precursor of magnetic activated carbons (MAC) for the first time. A simple methodology based on the impregnation of EPS samples with Fe3+ in solution, followed by pyrolysis under Ar pressure and chemical activation is proposed. The as-prepared carbonaceous magnetic materials present nanometric phases of Fe0, Fe3C, and Fe3O4, and showed high specific surface area (672 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.35 cm3 g−1), one of the highest found in the carbonaceous magnetic materials literature. Their excellent textural, chemical and electrical properties, combined with the possibility of magnetically collection and regeneration after operation guaranteed an excellent performance of MAC in two different applications: as adsorbents of organic contaminants and as electrodes of redox supercapacitors.',\n",

The median surface-normalized uptake rates of PBDEs, NBFRs, DPs, and OPEs were 170, 8.5, 4.8, and 270 ng/dm2/h for wristbands and 5.4, 2.0, 0.94, and 23 ng/dm2/h for T-shirts, respectively. Concentrations of Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), Tri-m-cresyl phosphate (TmCP), Bis(2-ethlyhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (BEH-TEBP), and Dechlorane plus (DPs) in wristbands were significantly correlated with those in T-shirts. Wristbands accumulated ~7 times more mass than T-shirts, especially of compounds expected to be mainly in the gas phase. We introduce the silicone “sandwich” method to approximate the easily releasable fraction (ERF) from T-shirts, hypothesized to be related to dermal exposure. ERFs varied from 6 to 75% of total chemical accumulated by T-shirts and were significantly negatively correlated with compounds' octanol-air partition coefficient (log K oa ). The median daily exposure doses via dermal transfer from the front of the T-shirt to the front body trunk were 0.32, 0.13, 0.11, and 9.1 ng/kg-BW/day for PBDEs, NBFRs, DPs, and OPEs, respectively. The evidence of e-waste recycler exposure to flame retardants in this low income country, lacking protective personal equipment, calls for measures to minimize their exposure and for chemical management regulations to consider exposures to chemicals in waste products.\",\n",

Different passive cleaning protocols in pilot plant and laboratory scale were followed using sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) at different concentrations and exposure time. The RFO with the best performance was selected for its transformation by interfacial polymerization (IP) technique to improve further the FO performance. Both the morphological structure and transport properties of the RFO and TRFO membranes were studied by means of different characterization techniques. Although the RFO membranes are suitable for FO, the TRFO membranes are more competitive. The highest FO water permeate fluxes (12.21 kg/m2·h and 15.12 kg/m2·h) were obtained for the membrane recycled applying the highest NaClO exposure dose applied in pilot plant (106 ppm·h) followed by IP of a thin polyamide layer. These permeate fluxes were better or at least comparable to commercial membranes used under the same FO conditions. The results indicated that it is possible to use discarded RO membranes in FO technology for wastewater treatment after adequate treatment procedures extending their lifetime and contributing to a circular economy and sustainability in membrane science and related materials.',\n",

As novel materials, and although there are some current applications in the market, there is still unknown areas under development. One key issue to be addressed is to know more about the implications of the nano-composite packaging materials once they become waste. The present study evaluates the extrusion process of four nanomaterials (Layered silicate modified nanoclay (Nanoclay1), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), Silver (Ag) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) as part of different virgin polymer matrices of polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethyleneterephtalate (PET). Thus, the following film plastic materials: (PE–Nanoclay1, PE–CaCO3, PP–Ag, PET–ZnO, PET–Ag, PET–Nanoclay1) have been processed considering different recycling scenarios. Results on recyclability show that for PE and PP, in general terms and except for some minor variations in yellowness index, tensile modulus, tensile strength and tear strength (PE with Nanoclay1, PP with Ag), the introduction of nanomaterial in the recycling streams for plastic films does not affect the final recycled plastic material in terms of mechanical properties and material quality compared to conventional recycled plastic. Regarding PET, results show that the increasing addition of nanomaterial into the recycled PET matrix (especially PET–Ag) could influence important properties of the recycled material, due to a slight degradation of the polymer, such as increasing pinholes, degradation fumes and elongation at break. Moreover, it should be noted that colour deviations were visible in most of the samples (PE, PP and PET) in levels higher than 0.3 units (limit perceivable by the human eye). The acceptance of these changes in the properties of recycled PE, PP and PET will depend on the specific applications considered (e.g. packaging applications are more strict in material quality that urban furniture or construction products).',\n",

       " {'context': 'The demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is exponentially rising driven by the increasing variety of their applications, which includes consumer electronics, stationary energy storage, and especially electromobility. To meet this increasing demand, recycling becomes necessary since, in addition to reducing the environmental impact of the LIBs, it mitigates the challenges of scarcity of lithium (Li) and other valuable metals such as cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn). In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a technology for recycling LIB cells that recovers active materials and other elements contained in LIB cells. The reported technology, which we denominated RecycLib, employs hydrometallurgy and can be applied to lithium cobalt oxide LiCoO2 (LCO) with cylindrical and prismatic geometries, as well as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NMC) cells. Experimental characterization reveals recovery efficiency rates of the cathodic metallic oxide higher than 90 % for LCO (with 98 % purity in the case of cylindrical LIB cells and 80 % for prismatic cells) and 80 % for NMC LIB cells (with 85 % purity) employing relatively inexpensive reagents with low environmental hazardous potential and sub-processes designed according to Circular Economy precepts. Therefore, it is envisaged that the proposed technology to show a low potential for environmental impact, low operating costs, and high work safety, thus favoring industrial scalability.',\n",

In this study, pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) over zeolite ZSM-5 has been carried out in a two-stage fixed bed pyrolysis system with a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. The role of plasma on the pyrolysis process, as well as the stability of the plasma-catalytic system was investigated. Compared to conventional catalytic pyrolysis, plasma-catalysis pyrolysis increased gas products from 29 wt% to 47 wt% with 4.19 mmol/g H2 formed, and improved the selectivity of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) whilst inhibiting the production of wax simultaneously. After 10 cycles, clear decreases in gas and oil yield (from 86 wt% to 48 wt%) and BTX selectivity (from 71 wt% to 39 wt%) were found in the conventional catalytic pyrolysis, however, nearly no variation was shown in the plasma-catalysis mode. The coupling of catalyst and plasma modified the catalysts acidic sites, while the radicals enhanced the pre-cracking of volatiles, resulting in less deposited coke. Overall, the introduction of plasma resulted in an obvious reduction in total costs and presented a feasible strategy for the recycling of waste plastic.',\n",

The current work deals with the abundance and characteristics of MPs in RDW composting, and the effects of composting processes on the composition of MPs. Compost samples from two RDW treatment stations were investigated, and a lab-scale experiment was carried out to verify the possible release of MPs from macroplastics (>25 mm) contained in the RDW during composting. MPs were identified using stereo-microscope and μ-FTIR. The average abundance of MPs (0.05–5 mm) in the RDW compost products was 2400 ± 358 items/kg (dry weight), and the main MPs shapes were fibers and films. Polyester, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the most common polymer types. MPs having a size <1 mm accounted for more than 50% of the total quantity. With the progress of composting, the proportion of MPs having size <1 mm increased, and more foam MPs were observed in the late stage of composting. Under the influence of mechanical force, oxidation and biodegradation, a piece of expanded polystyrene (EPS), PP and PE macroplastic could release 4–63 MPs particles during the composting. Thus, the RDW compost was a significant source of MPs in soils, and the MPs in compost products were closely related to the quantity and type of plastic waste present in RDW, which helped to suggest better MPs control strategies.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Mechanical recycling is to date the most commonly applied recycling technology. However, mechanical recycling of post-consumer plastics still faces many challenges, such as the presence of odorous constituents. Accordingly, recycling industry is looking for cost-effective solutions to improve the current washing efficiencies. However, scientific literature and basic understanding of deodorization processes are still scarce, which impedes efficient industrial optimization. Therefore, this study aims to obtain more fundamental insights in the deodorization mechanisms of plastic films in different washing media such as water, detergent, caustic soda, and ethyl acetate as organic solvent. The removal efficiencies of 19 odor components with a wide range of physicochemical properties were quantified via GC-MS analysis. The results revealed that deodorization depends on various factors such as temperature and physicochemical properties as polarity, volatility, and molecular weight of the odor components and the washing media. It was shown that polar washing media are less efficient compared to apolar media or media containing a detergent, achieving efficiencies of around 50% and 90%, respectively. The desorption processes can be accurately modeled by the isotherm model of Fritz-Schlunder in combination with a reversible first order kinetic model for the deodorization kinetics. Aspen Plus® process simulations of a water-based washing process reveal that at least 60% fresh water is needed to avoid saturation of the medium and undesired (re-)adsorption of odor components onto the plastics, which results in a substantial ecological footprint.',\n",

The external protection is aimed at increasing its lifetime and reducing the maintenance requirements of the railway lines. This study evaluates the environmental performances of this sleeper, under different operational conditions, in comparison with traditional pre-stressed reinforced concrete sleepers, using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The assessment includes 16 environmental, energy, and human health impact categories. It is performed considering the following functional unit: 1 railway sleeper, including the fastenings of the rail to the sleeper and the portion of the track bed underneath it, over one year of operation. The evaluated system includes the sleeper production, its installation, the railway maintenance, the sleeper removal at its end-of-life and the final recovery. Moreover, the ballast is included in the analysis considering its mining and transportation to the railway line, the partial replacement during maintenance operations, the removal during a track renewal, and the end-of-life management. For the worst operational conditions of the Greenrail sleeper, the potential impacts between the two sleeper typologies differ by <10% for most of the examined categories, meaning that no significant environmental differences are observed. In the average conditions, impact reductions for the Greenrail sleepers result bigger than 10% for 7 out of 16 categories. Finally, for the best conditions, benefits are in the range 20% - 30% for 11 impact categories.',\n",

Ca, Ce, La, Mg and Mn were used to promote the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in order to enhance the production of higher syngas yield. The modified catalysts can enhanced the reaction rate of the pyrolysis process and resulting in high syngas in the product yields. Especially cerium, lanthanum promoted catalysts can enhance the yield of syngas. The effect of the reaction temperature and nitrogen/oxygen ratio of the carrier gas was also investigated. The maximum syngas production was obtained with lanthanum catalyst (112.2 mmol/g (95%N2 and 5%O2), and 130.7 mmol/g (90%N2 and 10%O2) at 850 °C. Less carbon depositions was found at 850 °C or even by the using of catalyst and more oxygen in the carrier gas. The oxygen content of the pyrolysis-gasification atmosphere had a key role to the syngas yield and affects significantly the carbon-monoxide/carbon-dioxide ratio. Catalysts can also accelerate the methanization reactions and isomerize the main carbon frame. Increasing in both temperature and oxygen in the atmosphere led to higher n-paraffin/n-olefin ratio and more multi-ring aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolysis oils. The concentration of hydrocarbons containing oxygen and branched compounds was also significantly affected by catalysts.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this study, the microbiological food safety of using anaerobic digestate as a fertilizer in hydroponic production of vegetables was evaluated. The used anaerobic digestate was a liquid residue obtained from the digestion of food waste in the production of biogas. Replacing the customary inorganic fertilizer used in hydroponic production with this recycled fertilizer (biofertilizer) could allow for sustainable urban food production close to retailers and consumers. However, in striving for circular food production, it is vital that the food safety of utilizing recycled resources is ensured. Especially in the application of hydroponic farming, where the nutrient loop is shorter than on arable land, a microbiological food safety risk assessment is crucial when adopting new and recycled fertilizers. The biofertilizer based on anaerobic digestate was therefore studied with regard to its microbial community (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) during production of vegetables in a hydroponic system. The biofertilizer was also challenge tested with food borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus). Furthermore, the microbial activity of the biofertilizer was studied using isothermal calorimetry. The results showed that the microbial community of the biofertilizer changed distinctly through a necessary initial nitrification process, and that the most abundant genus was Mycobacterium. Deliberate contaminations with 5 log10 CFU mL−1 of either S. enterica or L. monocytogenes in the nitrified biofertilizer were no longer detectable with selective plating after 48 h of incubation at 20 °C. Selective plating for B. cereus revealed that the biofertilizer contained low levels (∼10 CFU mL−1) of the bacterium, and an inoculation of 5 log10 CFU mL−1 B. cereus decreased to these levels within 24 h of incubation at 20 °C. Analysis of the microbial activity of the biofertilizer indicated that the biofertilizer does not seem to support microbial activity without the addition of an external nutrient source that contains an accessible carbon source and trace elements. The type of biofertilizer investigated in this study is thus regarded as microbiologically safe for use in hydroponic cultivation. The constant presence of viable B. cereus, however, emphasizes the fundamental importance of continuous risk assessment in case of any modifications or supplementations of the biofertilizer, since it clearly can act as a reservoir for bacterial endospores.',\n",

For decades, the plastic or synthetic polymer persists without deterioration in the soil. The aim of this analysis was to separate the bacteria from the soil of landfill and to evaluate the microbial degradation of the sheet of low-density polythene (LDPE) for 180 days. The microbial degradation was characterized by weight loss, alteration of pH in the media, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and microscopic view. Molecular identification of bacteria was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using 16SrRNA gene sequence. The bacteria were identified as Ralstonia sp. strain SKM2 and Bacillus sp. strain SM1. The weight loss in LDPE sheet by Ralstonia sp. strain SKM2 and Bacillus sp. strain SM1was 39.2%and 18.9%respectively The pH of media was reduced from 7.12 to 6.67 for Ralstonia sp. strain SKM2 bacterium and 7.12 to 7.03 for Bacillus sp. strain SM1 bacterium. Clearly noticeable structural changes such as blackness, shrinkage, cracks, pits, and roughening of LDPE sheet surface were detected by microscope. FTIR also observed changes in the carbon bonds (especially alcohol), ether and alkane groups of LDPE sheet.Thus, the Ralstonia sp. strain SKM2 and Bacillussp. strain SM1 could be used as LDPE degrading microorganisms.',\n",

Tests for compressive strength, water absorption, capillary rise, tightness, porosity, density, volumetric density, mercury porosimetry, optical and scanning microscopy were carried out. The best results were obtained for samples with the addition of 10% basalt powder and 10% water. They were characterized by the highest compressive strength, high tightness, moderate water absorption and a high proportion of closed pores in the sample. Nevertheless, all tested samples meet the requirements for wall building materials. The results of scanning microscopy show that all samples have a similar microstructure, C-S-H phases and tobermorite were formed.

Selective separation methods for PVC containing hazardous chlorine are required for the development of suitable disposal or material recycling processes. However, separating PVC selectively from municipal plastic waste mixtures is difficult due to their similar hydrophobic surface and appearance densities. This study presents a one-step, selective separation technique for PVC using H2O2 solution under ultrasonic irrigation to promote the selective development of hydrophilicity only on the PVC surface. The combined treatment helped to decrease air bubbles attached on the PVC surface because of increased wettability, which allowed the treated PVC to settle on the bottom of the flotation reactor. However, the remaining plastic wastes were easily floated off because they maintained their hydrophobicity. The combined treatment with a low concentration of 3% H2O2 and ultrasonic irrigation for 30\\u202fmin afforded 100% purity and recovery of the PVC separated from the municipal plastic waste mixture. This proposed treatment is therefore a promising and inexpensive way to improve plastic recycling quality through selective PVC separation by the selective development of hydrophilicity on its surface.',\n",

An important issue in the environmental horticulture sector is the reduction and utilization of horticultural waste including plastic containers, trays, plastic greenhouse covers and field covers, and plastic bags. Using data collected through a survey in 2013, this paper identifies factors that influence the sector’s decision to participate in waste recycling programs in Georgia, USA. The study employs a decision model. Results indicate that significant determinants of the recycle decision include the firm size, motivation for recycling, current recycling situation, as well as owner/manager education level. To help firms to recycle, local governments, the environmental horticulture sector, and environmental protection organizations need to focus on lower-revenue and small size firms, broadly disseminate recycle program information, and enhance the local recycler’s services.',\n",

For the results from model low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pyrolysis, the C8-C16 aliphatics and monocyclic aromatics were dominant constitutes of the liquid product with the yields ranging from 22 to 68 wt%. At the temperature of 500 °C and biochar to LDPE ratio surpassing 3, the LDPE could be completely degraded into liquid and gas without wax production. A wax yield of 16 wt% was observed at the temperature of 450 °C and biochar to LDPE ratio of 4, which was dramatically lower than that (77 wt%) from the absence of biochar at the temperature of 500 °C. Up to 92 vol% of H2 was detected in the gaseous product with a yield of 36 wt%. The lower temperatures and higher biochar to LDPE ratios favored increasing the generation of H2 at the expense of light gas C n H m especially CH4. Moreover, this biochar catalyst was tested effectively to convert the real waste plastics including grocery bags and packaging tray into valuable liquid and H2-enriched gas.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Many solid waste policy makers are adopting sustainability practices following one of the three most commonly followed approaches: zero-waste, circular economy, and sustainable materials management (SMM). Although some communities have embraced these models, challenges remain to integrate these concepts into solid waste policy and planning. Several approaches for integrating SMM were demonstrated. The approaches centered on using SMM concepts to prioritize and strategically plan for more sustainable waste management and to create performance metrics to track solid waste management system progress. Waste information from five regions were compiled to assess current data adequacy; necessary data were in many cases limited. Findings showed that many of the regions will need to better track and report their individual materials generated and disposed of to more accurately apply SMM. Among the common outcomes of the SMM approaches illustrated was the need to better target specific materials in the waste stream for recovery, such as metal and paper products. Other findings included the need to more effectively promote and track waste reduction efforts given the dramatic beneficial outcomes when using an SMM-based performance metric, such as an energy use reduction goal.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Glass packaging gives rise to major environmental concerns because it develops more greenhouse gas emissions than plastic packaging and its improper discarding causes the loss of high-quality desired resources. The reuse and recycling of glass packaging reduces greenhouse gas emissions and the use of newly extracted resources sand and soda. To mitigate the environmental impacts of glass packaging, countries have set-up various collection and recycling systems, which are often organized and financed through extended producer responsibility schemes. The most common collection systems are deposit-refund systems (DRS), separate collection in drop-off containers and comingled collection with lightweight packaging waste. By the end of 2035 a minimum of 65 % of glass packaging waste must be prepared for re-use and/or recycled within the EU Member States and thus proper policies and solutions should be adopted to achieve this target. In this sense, the present study aims at verifying if deposit-refund systems and their different configurations affect glass packaging waste reduction and recycling/recovery. To achieve this aim, annual data regarding consumption and recycling/recovery of glass packaging for each European Economic Area/European Free Trade Association (EEA/EFTA) country were extracted over the time period 2010–2019. By using the selected European countries as units of analysis, a hybrid methodology was developed which includes the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other descriptive statistics. Findings show that the different waste management systems affect neither the amount of glass packaging consumption nor the glass packaging recycling/recovery. In countries which adopt DRS, not more glass packaging per capita was retrieved than in countries which adopt other collection and management systems. In fact, it turns out to be a mechanism that allows for high quality glass packaging collection avoiding its ending up in landfills, but it does not influence consumption choices and the subsequent potential waste production. The adoption of DRS-based collections does not result necessarily in a successful management model for glass packaging. Since setting up additional drop-off collection points and recovering mechanically glass from municipal solid waste (MSW) does not result in glass qualities to be used in glass packaging, DRS represent still the sole progress towards a more circular economy.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products comprise a large portion of plastic wastes and cause severe environmental burdens in thermal recycling such as toxic release and disposal difficulties. Selective separation methods for PVC containing hazardous chlorine are required for the development of suitable disposal or material recycling processes. However, separating PVC selectively from municipal plastic waste mixtures is difficult due to their similar hydrophobic surface and appearance densities. This study presents a one-step, selective separation technique for PVC using H2O2 solution under ultrasonic irrigation to promote the selective development of hydrophilicity only on the PVC surface. The combined treatment helped to decrease air bubbles attached on the PVC surface because of increased wettability, which allowed the treated PVC to settle on the bottom of the flotation reactor. However, the remaining plastic wastes were easily floated off because they maintained their hydrophobicity. The combined treatment with a low concentration of 3% H2O2 and ultrasonic irrigation for 30\\u202fmin afforded 100% purity and recovery of the PVC separated from the municipal plastic waste mixture. This proposed treatment is therefore a promising and inexpensive way to improve plastic recycling quality through selective PVC separation by the selective development of hydrophilicity on its surface.',\n",

Owing to their variable pore size, high surface area, surface reactivity, structural flexibility, stability, and low toxicity SiNPs are appealing to be employed in numerous fields including biomedicine and environment remediation. Though several methods are being applied for the synthesis of SiNPs from various sources; the key inclination in this regard is the concept of environment safety and \"green\" technologies. Numerous low-cost and renewable materials are being investigated as a source of precursor materials for the synthesis of SiNPs and agricultural waste holds great potential in this regard. Due to the abundance of silica in diverse agricultural residues, synthesis of nano-silica from them, leads to new possibilities for agro-waste management and valorization. For extraction of bonded silica from agrowastes different conventional methods are in place, however extraction, mediated by microbes can make the process further eco-friendly and hence holds great research potential. The biological extraction of these nanoparticles from agricultural waste and the mechanism behind it is not much explored and reviewed. This review highlights several agricultural wastes which can be applied as precursor for generation of SiNPs and elaborates the mechanism behind biological extraction of SiNPs from agro-waste in detail. We have also discussed various applications of SiNPs, emphasizing their role in environment monitoring, detection and bioremediation. Finally, we have discussed the challenges in producing nano-sized silica from agro-waste, along with research priorities in this field that will help researchers for further investigations in this field.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The recycling of any kind of plastic to convert it in valuable products is one of the main challenges of today’s society. Besides, if the recycling process is itself green, then it would be a great achievement. This paper reviews the way covered from the first attempts of reusing the polyurethane (PU) scraps as a filler for cushions to the last chemical routes employing green recycling agents. Polyurethane is the 6th most used polymer all over the world with a production of 18 millions tons per year, which means a daily production of PU specialties greater than 1 million of cubic meters, equivalent to the volume of the Empire State Building. The thermostable nature of the majority of the polyurethanes specialties has made that the preferred solution for their recycling are the chemical recycling processes. Among them, glycolysis is the one that receives a greater attention from an industrial point of view, so this review puts the spotlight on it. However, the existing reviews in literature do not paid a special attention on glycolysis and only give a superficial description of the process. Nevertheless, in the present review, the scientific literature relative to glycolysis is completely reviewed, updated and ordered according the type of PU specialty recycled. Additionally, the other main chemical recycling processes are also revisited in a more extended and deeper way than in the previous approaches to this topic. Moreover, it is crucial to take into account that some of these technologies, which were described in the literature as promising technologies at laboratory scale are now commercial processes running at industrial scale. For that reason, it is essential to remark that the present review comprises not only a detailed state of art of the scientific literature on the subject, also includes a detailed revision of the past and running on pilot plants and industrial facilities, including several patents, which has never been covered in the current literature. Moreover, this review also describes the most recent studies employing crude glycerol (biodiesel subproduct) as an economic, sustainable and environmental friendly cleavage agent, which should lead the way to the industrial implantation of split-phase glycolysis in a near future, providing high quality recovered products, susceptible of replacing raw ones in the synthesis of new PU specialties. What is more, this review intends that any reader could know and understand the reactions involved in the polyurethane chemistry and recycling, the main polyurethanes types and the fundamentals of the recycling strategies in order to comprehend what are the advantages and drawbacks of each recycling process as starting point for looking for new advantageous alternatives from an environmental, technical and economic point of view. Broader context. This paper reviews the main advances in the polyurethane (PU) recycling field, from laboratory and academia processes to pilot plant and industrial scale ones, including the most relevant patents in the subject. Opposite to other common used plastics, PUs are not polymerization but condensation polymers, synthesized from polyols and isocyanates. The wide diversity of polyols and isocyanates allows the synthesis of numerous different compounds covering a huge range of applications. As a direct consequence of their commercial success, an increasing quantity of PU waste is being disposed by landfilling in the last decades. Such waste comprises not only post-consumer products but also scrap from slabstock manufacturing, which can reach the 10% of the total foam production. However, the massive enforcement of the environmental laws is pointing out a new route in the polymer waste removal sector based in the polymer recycling, and this fact has placed the research in waste treatment as one of the most prolific topics nowadays. In fact, polymer recycling processes have experienced a growing attention from the research and industrial worlds as a direct result of the enforcement of the environmental legislations. Hence, it is essential to develop new environmental sustainable recycling processes with the aim of conserving the natural resources, reducing the amount of waste disposed in landfills and enhancing the sustainability for forthcoming generation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Many solid waste policy makers are adopting sustainability practices following one of the three most commonly followed approaches: zero-waste, circular economy, and sustainable materials management (SMM). Although some communities have embraced these models, challenges remain to integrate these concepts into solid waste policy and planning. Several approaches for integrating SMM were demonstrated. The approaches centered on using SMM concepts to prioritize and strategically plan for more sustainable waste management and to create performance metrics to track solid waste management system progress. Waste information from five regions were compiled to assess current data adequacy; necessary data were in many cases limited. Findings showed that many of the regions will need to better track and report their individual materials generated and disposed of to more accurately apply SMM. Among the common outcomes of the SMM approaches illustrated was the need to better target specific materials in the waste stream for recovery, such as metal and paper products. Other findings included the need to more effectively promote and track waste reduction efforts given the dramatic beneficial outcomes when using an SMM-based performance metric, such as an energy use reduction goal.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Glass packaging gives rise to major environmental concerns because it develops more greenhouse gas emissions than plastic packaging and its improper discarding causes the loss of high-quality desired resources. The reuse and recycling of glass packaging reduces greenhouse gas emissions and the use of newly extracted resources sand and soda. To mitigate the environmental impacts of glass packaging, countries have set-up various collection and recycling systems, which are often organized and financed through extended producer responsibility schemes. The most common collection systems are deposit-refund systems (DRS), separate collection in drop-off containers and comingled collection with lightweight packaging waste. By the end of 2035 a minimum of 65 % of glass packaging waste must be prepared for re-use and/or recycled within the EU Member States and thus proper policies and solutions should be adopted to achieve this target. In this sense, the present study aims at verifying if deposit-refund systems and their different configurations affect glass packaging waste reduction and recycling/recovery. To achieve this aim, annual data regarding consumption and recycling/recovery of glass packaging for each European Economic Area/European Free Trade Association (EEA/EFTA) country were extracted over the time period 2010–2019. By using the selected European countries as units of analysis, a hybrid methodology was developed which includes the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other descriptive statistics. Findings show that the different waste management systems affect neither the amount of glass packaging consumption nor the glass packaging recycling/recovery. In countries which adopt DRS, not more glass packaging per capita was retrieved than in countries which adopt other collection and management systems. In fact, it turns out to be a mechanism that allows for high quality glass packaging collection avoiding its ending up in landfills, but it does not influence consumption choices and the subsequent potential waste production. The adoption of DRS-based collections does not result necessarily in a successful management model for glass packaging. Since setting up additional drop-off collection points and recovering mechanically glass from municipal solid waste (MSW) does not result in glass qualities to be used in glass packaging, DRS represent still the sole progress towards a more circular economy.',\n",

The optimization of pyrolysis conditions between PVC and cattle manure was studied via a statistical method, the Box–Behnken model. The pyrolysis reaction was operated in a tubular reactor. Heating rate, reaction temperature and the PVC:cattle manure ratio were optimized in the range of 1–5°C/min, 250–450°C and the ratio of 1:1–1:5, respectively. The suitable conditions which provided the highest HCl reduction efficiency were the lowest heating rate of 1°C/min, the highest reaction temperature of 450°C, and the PVC:cattle manure ratio of 1:5, with reliability of more than 90%. The copyrolysis of the mixture of PVC-containing plastic and cattle manure was operated at optimized conditions and the synergistic effect was studied on product yields. The presence of manure decreased the oil yield by about 17%. The distillation fractions of oil at various boiling points from both the presence and absence of manure were comparable. The BTX concentration decreased rapidly when manure was present and the chlorinated hydrocarbon was reduced by 45%. However, the octane number of the gasoline fraction was not affected by manure and was in the range of 99–100.',\n",

Chemical recycling has been identified as a promising method to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemical products. In this work, a simple and high-efficient method initiated by microwave plasma discharging is proposed to decompose plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes, wherein iron-based catalysts are used as the microwave susceptor and metal tips are utilized to induce plasma discharging. Iron-based catalysts supported on activated carbons calcinated at 400 °C have displayed the best catalytic activity due to the excellent physicochemical properties. Massive H2 rapidly evolves out in the 25 s with a hydrogen efficiency of over 85%. The yield of H2 with plasma discharging by using Fe/AC-400 catalyst is near 300 mmol·g-1Hplastic, which exhibits a 6 times improvement compared to 41 mmol·g-1Hplastic without plasma discharging by using AC catalyst. Little other gases including CH4, CO and CO2 are detected while high-value carbon nanotubes are fabricated. The continuity test over Fe/AC-400 catalyst with microwave plasma discharging presents the distinct ability to generate CNTs continuously. The decomposition for three kinds of plastics has demonstrated the extremely high universal and potential in practical application for real-world plastic wastes.',\n",

The external protection is aimed at increasing its lifetime and reducing the maintenance requirements of the railway lines. This study evaluates the environmental performances of this sleeper, under different operational conditions, in comparison with traditional pre-stressed reinforced concrete sleepers, using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The assessment includes 16 environmental, energy, and human health impact categories. It is performed considering the following functional unit: 1 railway sleeper, including the fastenings of the rail to the sleeper and the portion of the track bed underneath it, over one year of operation. The evaluated system includes the sleeper production, its installation, the railway maintenance, the sleeper removal at its end-of-life and the final recovery. Moreover, the ballast is included in the analysis considering its mining and transportation to the railway line, the partial replacement during maintenance operations, the removal during a track renewal, and the end-of-life management. For the worst operational conditions of the Greenrail sleeper, the potential impacts between the two sleeper typologies differ by <10% for most of the examined categories, meaning that no significant environmental differences are observed. In the average conditions, impact reductions for the Greenrail sleepers result bigger than 10% for 7 out of 16 categories. Finally, for the best conditions, benefits are in the range 20% - 30% for 11 impact categories.',\n",

       " {'context': \"This article analyzes the effect of fire on plasterboards with aggregates of plastic cable waste, considering the plaster coating as a strategy to reduce the flammability of the added polymers. A real test was performed, using a direct fire set in a Madrid fire station, and a theoretical estimate of the composition of the gas emissions, focused in CO2 and CO, during a fire in a type room is presented. The results reflect that there is no clear trend between the evolution of temperatures over time and the amount of plastic waste added to the plaster matrix in the different specimens, but a different behavior is obtained depending on the surroundings where they are located. Temperatures of 600\\u202f°C are reached between 5 and 10\\u202fmin after the start of the fire if they are located in a place with heat containment, and they do not reach 400\\u202f°C in the same period of time in a place with less heat containment. It was also observed that gypsum can be considered a passive protection of polymers, as it retards the effect of the flame on them. Concerning the gases released, the theoretical calculations, based on the elemental and thermogravimetric analysis of the plastic cable waste, reveal that the amount of carbon dioxide generated in a fire would not pose a risk to people's health whereas the values obtained for the carbon monoxide exceed the limited considered dangerous to health for a period greater than 15\\u202fmin. Using plastic cable waste as secondary raw material reduces the number of incinerations to be carried out in landfills with this type of waste, thereby decreasing the potential emission of contaminants into the atmosphere and contributing to the sustainability of our planet.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Chemical upcycling rubber wastes into hydrocarbon fuels offers a promising approach toward achieving carbon neutrality. To generate fuel-range cycloalkanes and isoalkanes from natural rubber glove wastes (NRGWs), the depolymerization of NRGWs was performed by integrating hydropyrolysis with vapor-phase hydrogenation over a bifunctional Ni/Al2O3-SiO2 catalyst. Isoprene and limonene were the primary alkenes obtained from the non-catalytic hydropyrolysis of NRGWs, and these intermediates were vapor-phase hydrotreated over Ni/Al2O3-SiO2 producing C10 cycloalkane as the dominant fuel-range products. Complete hydrogenation of isoprene and limonene was achieved under a catalyst to feedstock mass ratio of 2.0, giving a maximum gasoline yield of 92 wt% under 225 °C hydrogenation temperature at 0.2 MPa H2. A low hydropyrolysis temperature of 450 °C maximized C10 cycloalkane yield at 72.3 wt% with 80.1% selectivity, while a high temperature of 600 °C yielded 76.6 wt% C5 isoalkane. A deconstruction mechanism in the catalytic cascade upcycling of NRGWs was proposed by employing limonene hydrogenation as a probe reaction. The results demonstrate that upcycling polymer wastes by cascade hydropyrolysis‑hydrogenation is a promising approach to produce alternative fuels with improved properties.',\n",

Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19.

This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public.

Besides, to obtain eco-friendly concretes incorporating wastes and be able to employ them in concrete structures, knowing their mechanical characteristics is essential. Therefore, in this research, the three-point bending test was conducted on 240 notched beams to determine the effect of the partial substitution of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flakes for fine aggregates at volume percentages of 0, 5, 10, and 15% on the fracture characteristics and ductility of SCC in two states: without heat treatment and after the application of 200, 400, and 600 °C. For this purpose, the two methods of size effect method (SEM) and work of fracture method (WFM) were used to analyze and interpret fracture parameters. The analysis of the obtained results demonstrated in the specimens without PET, after the heat treatment, fracture energy values obtained from WFM and SEM, as well as the fracture toughness ( K IC ) obtained from SEM, declined. Moreover, the results obtained for the effective size of the process zone ( c f ) parameter in SEM and characteristic length ( l ch ) parameter in WFM demonstrated that the concrete without PET became more brittle and less ductile. On the contrary, in concretes incorporating PET, as the temperature increased, the fracture energy and toughness levels of the SCC declined, but its ductility increased. Moreover, considering the size effect design, the behavior of the SCC approached the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) criterion as the temperature increased and the substitution percentage of PET for fine aggregate decreased. On average, in all the specimens, the fracture energy values obtained from WFM were 2.35 times those obtained from SEM. Finally, based on the obtained mechanical characteristics and test variables, multivariate models were presented to predict the fracture parameters of SCC incorporating PET after tolerating elevated temperatures and compared with the experimental results of the present research and literature. A proper accuracy was observed for the models.',\n",

In this study, a thermal plasma treatment process was evaluated for its efficiency to process solid radioactive waste. Experiments were carried out with the application of stable isotopes of Lead, Iodine, Cobalt, and Cesium. After the thermal plasma treatments, the slag and the residual gas were analyzed to verify the influence of process time and discharge power on the efficiency of the process. The treatment for 25 min and 10 kW was sufficient to reduce the mass by 50% of the slag. When the applied power was increased to 15 kW, an expressive reduction in the treatment time (10 min) was able to promote the same mass reduction. The results indicated that the treatment of radioactive waste by thermal plasma is a promising method to manage and reduce the mass and volume for the final disposal.',\n",

OPLS all atom force filed was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Root mean square fluctuation of monomers of polyethylene, radius of gyration, diffusion constant and hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area of polymer molecule is calculated in investigating supercritical solvents. The results showed that flexibility of both ends of molecule is more than flexibility of internal monomers in three supercritical solvents. Also, flexibility of polyethylene oligomer in supercritical water is greater than flexibility of polyethylene in supercritical alcohols. Compactness of polyethylene was increased during molecular dynamics simulation in supercritical water. Among three solvents, supercritical ethanol has greater diffusion constant than the other ones. Although single aggregate structure was not observed, ethanol comes closer to polyethylene molecule during simulation than the other solvents. It seems that supercritical water has two roles in depolymerization of polyethylene; solvent and reactant, but supercritical alcohols acts only as solvent.',\n",

PET chemical recycling was divided into the following categories of reactions: hydrolysis, glycolysis, alcoholysis and aminolysis, and each of these groups has been characterized. On the basis of the available literature, the methods used to carry out the reaction, the conditions of their conduct and the synthesis products obtained were presented.

       " {'context': \"The use of Waste Tire Crumb Rubber (WTCR) instead of aggregates in cement-based concretes has been expanded to produce more sustainable, lighter, and ductile concrete with more damping. However, it creates weaknesses in the mechanical properties of concrete, such as compressive and flexural strength. This study proposes an innovative surface double pre-coating with resin and micro-silica to improve the bond at the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) between WTCR and cement paste. The WTCR replaced natural fine aggregates by volume ranging from 0% to 30%. The scanning electron microscopy images are used to investigate the changes in the created gaps and micro-cracks in ITZ. The modified rubber concrete's compressive, modulus of elasticity, and flexural strength are improved by using double pre-coated rubber methods up to 60%, 28%, and 30%, respectively. Also, the ultimate strain capacity is still more than the ultimate strain capacity of ordinary concrete. The results show that the double-pre-coating resin and micro-silica methods have the maximum effect in increasing the concrete samples' mechanical performance.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'The majority of discarded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites worldwide are dumped as waste in landfills, entailing major environmental concerns. Recycling and reusing these discarded FRP composites remain a big challenge. In this work, a possible method for using the recycled glass fiber chips (GFC) as a reinforcement material for bitumen used in pavement is proposed to solve this issue. For this purpose, GFC with different lengths and diameters were chosen and dispersed evenly into bitumen with three mass contents. To gain a throughout understanding of the reinforcement effect of GFC in bitumen, a range of basic properties, such as the high-temperature performance, low-temperature performance and water resistance, were thoroughly investigated by the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test, bending beam rheometer (BBR) test, single-edge notched beam (SENB) test and surface free energy (SFE) test. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of reinforcement through the addition of GFC was revealed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is interesting that GFC can not only significantly improve the high-temperature performance of bitumen, such as the stiffness, rutting resistance, and creep and recovery behaviors, but also inhibits low-temperature cracking and improve the water resistance of asphalt mixture. These results are attributed to the stable three-dimensional structure created by the network of GFC in the bitumen. The GFC also enhances the material behavior through a bridging function and the specific pull-out behavior. The optimal geometry of GFC as a reinforcement additive was determined to be a diameter of 0.5–0.71 mm and a length of 10–12 mm, the optimal mass content was found to be 5% from this study. Based on the present investigation, it is highly recommended to use the recycled GFC as a reinforcement material in bitumen in both high- and low-temperature regions. Besides, the application of the recycled GFC can reduce the environmental footprint as well as costs.',\n",

Further, RF and SVM were employed for PET discrimination using the simplified input datasets composed of 62 VOCs with the highest contributions to the RF prediction performance derived by the AUCRF algorithm, by which over 99% prediction accuracy was achieved.

These types of construction and demolition waste were used as aggregates replacement (i.e. waste of cement/concrete debris, waste of ceramic tiles and the waste of building blocks) as well as natural and river sand. Unsaturated polyester resin was used as cement replacement. The weight percentages of resin were changed within (20, 25 and 30) % to manufacture this polymer concrete. Physical test such as density and mechanical tests such as compressive strength, flexural strength, Splitting tensile strength and Schmidt hammer were performed. The results proved that all the mechanical properties of all prepared mortars were increased with increasing the weight percentage of polymer added while the density was decreased. This encourages us to us to use this type of polymer mortar in different applications as precast or partitions with high toughness.',\n",

On the other hand, the use of fibers resulting from waste is an interesting issue to avoid the negative impact of these wastes on the environment as well as converting them from useless to other valuable materials. Limited studies addressed the mechanical and structural performance of the locally produced waste rope fibers (WRF) and their reuse in concrete. As a result, the goal of this research is to see how different percentages of WRF (0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% by weight of concrete) affect the workability, mechanical (such as compressive and flexural strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and bulk density) and structural (such as load deflection, crack width and propagation, and ductility index) properties of concrete. Results indicated that WRF improved the compressive and flexural strength of concrete by up to 22% and 4.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the width of cracks of reinforced concrete beams was considerably reduced and the ductility index of WRF-based beams was 3.07–3.24 compared to 1.45 for fiber-free beams.',\n",

Four different feeds were used (VGO, VGO\\u202f+\\u202f5\\u202fwt% HDPE, VGO\\u202f+\\u202f20\\u202fwt% of wax, and 100\\u202fwt% wax) in experiments performed in a laboratory-scaled riser simulator, with similar conditions to those of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit: equilibrium catalyst; 530\\u202f°C; catalyst/feed mass ratio, 5; contact time, 6\\u202fs. The results of the different characterization techniques of the deactivated catalyst and the coke indicate that the catalyst fouling decreases notably by incorporating these waste streams, changing its nature to a more aliphatic (olefinic) one and its location towards the zeolite micropores. On the contrary, the coke formed from the VGO is more evolved and mainly constituted by polyaromatic components deposited on the mesopores of the catalyst matrix. Product distribution is also affected, increasing the yield of light cycle oil and keeping a relatively similar gasoline yield, with greater olefinity and lower aromaticity. Thus, the FCC shows great perspectives to valorize polyolefins, present in waste plastics, at great scale.',\n",

Unquantified amounts of plastic materials are discharged into coastal waters with detrimental effects on local marine environments. With the expansion of the tourism industry, waste increasingly originates from tourism activities and ends up into the ocean due to poor management of solid waste post-consumption. This study explores the sources, abundance, and type of litter in Zanzibar, Tanzania by surveying four coastal tourism sites. The analysis illustrates the contributions to plastic pollution of four sectors of Zanzibar's economy (residential households, building and construction, tourism, and commercial sector). Findings suggest that plastic accounted for almost half (48.5%) of the waste inflow to the environment, and single-use packaging was the dominant litter item on all sampled sites.\",\n",

However, these plastics are based on synthetic components which are not biodegradable, thus they rigorously effect the environment causing water, air pollution and high health risks. Moreover, Individuals are exposed to chemicals during manufacturing or usage of synthetic plastic that can easily migrate to the surrounding such as styrene from polystyrene, plasticizers from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antioxidants from polyethylene, and acetaldehyde from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and they lead to several human diseases. The authors studied the economic feasibility of producing Polylactic Acid (PLA) as a replacement for synthetic polymers.

The biomass was pretreated with 2% (W/V) sodium hydroxide (SH) solution at 85\\u202f°C for 90\\u202fmin and subsequently subjected to separate saccharification and fermentation. Accordingly, the produced black liquor (BL) and waste wash-water (WWW) were sequentially withdrawn and partially fed back to the next pretreatment and washing processes, respectively. The results indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass was substantially improved from 24.8% up to 90.8% following the alkali pretreatment; and afterward, it was progressively decreased to a minimum value of 66.4% upon recycling BL and WWW for ten times. Parallel hydrolysis experiments were conducted in the presence of three non-ionic environmentally-friendly surfactants at different concentrations (0.25–2% V/V). Notably, supplementation with 0.5% (V/V) Tween 80 significantly improved hydrolysis yield of recycled BL (RBL) pretreated substrate to a maximum value of ~88%. Fermentation of the RBL-pretreated Cogongrass did not reveal any cell inhibition and resulted in maximum ~76% ethanol production yield, while also saving 59% of the water consumption and over 45% of the alkali usage. Detailed analyses of the biomass using semi-quantitative techniques revealed that enhanced cellulose accessibility to the enzyme, decreased crystallinity, and extensive lignin and hemicellulose removal were the key factors contributing to the observed improvements.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recycling of ‘End of Life Tyres’ (ELT) is one of the major environmental concerns faced by the scientific community and the government organisations, worldwide. Every year, an estimated one billion tyres reach their end of life, out of which only about 50% are currently being recycled and the remaining form part of the landfills. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the existing and develop new applications of recycled tyre products to address this shortfall in the utilisation rate of the ELT. One application which is actively being researched is the use of waste tyre rubber as a partial replacement of conventional aggregates in concrete applications. Although it shows tremendous potential, it comes with its own challenges such as weak inherent strength of the rubber and poor bond performance with the cement matrix, which hinders its use as an aggregate in large quantities. To overcome this challenge, researchers have looked at various rubber treatment methods that not only improve the bond performance but also significantly improve the mechanical properties of rubber concrete. This review paper considers the effect of rubber particle size, percentage replacement and various treatment methods on different mechanical properties of rubber concrete, studied over the last 30 years. However, to be accepted by the concrete industry, the researchers have to come up with a rubber treatment method that can address the concerns of high flammability and the resultant release of noxious gases from the rubber particles, when exposed to fire.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Algal culturing in photobioreactors for biofuel and other value-added products is a challenge globally specifically due to expensive closed or open photobioreactors associated with the high cost, problems of water loss and contamination. Among the wide varieties of microalgae, diatoms have come out as potential source for crude oil in the form of Diafuel™ (biofuel from diatoms). However, culturing diatoms at large scale hypothesized as diatom solar panels for biofuel production is still facing a need for facile and economical production of value-added products. The aim of this work was to culture diatom (microalgae) in a closed system by sealing the reactor rim tightly with very cheap priced and used plastic bubble wrap material which is generally discarded in a lodging and transportation of goods. To optimize it, different plastic wraps discarded from a plastic industry were tested first for their permeability to gases and impermeability to water loss. It was found that among different varieties of plastic bubble wraps, low density polyethylene (LDPE) bubble wrap material which was used to seal glass containers as photobioreactors allowed harvest of maximum Diafuel™ (37%), lipid (35 μgmL−1), highest cell count (1152 × 102 cells mL−1), maximum CO2 absorbance (0.084) with almost no water loss and nutrient uptake for 40 days of experiments. This was due to its permeability to gases and impermeability to water. To check usability of such LDPE bubble wrap on other microalgae it was therefore tested on the red-green microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, which showed scope to be scaled up for astaxanthin production using discarded bubble wrap packing material. This study thus would open up a new way for decreasing plastic disposal and with reuse for sustainable development and application of diatom in biofuel production which could find applications in environmental and industrial sectors.',\n",

LDPE700 exhibited almost identical combustion characteristics and brake thermal efficiency to that of diesel operation, with lower NOX, CO and CO2 emissions but higher unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). On the contrary, EVA900 presented longer ignition delay period, lower efficiency (1.5–2%), higher NOX and UHC emissions and lower CO and CO2 in comparison to diesel. The addition of diesel to the EVA900 did not significantly improve the overall engine performance.',\n",

       " {'context': \"A circular supply chain consists of emission and wastes minimization technologies with a remarkable gain in profit, which is the aim of any industry that is concerned about environmental conservation. One of the most critical hurdles to the transition to sustainability is waste management. This study proposes a circular sustainable integrated model in a plastic reforming industry with investment in 3D printing techniques to minimize waste, emission reduction, and ordering cost reduction and it led to optimal profit. The customer's demand and the unit profit depend on the circularity index of the item. This paper looked at three scenarios with partial backlogging: (a) linear demand versus linear unit profit; (b) linear demand versus exponential unit profit; and (c) linear demand versus logistic unit profit. An algorithm was used to optimize the profit of the plastic reforming industry with optimal values of ordering quantity, circularity index, and investment in waste minimization, emission reduction, and ordering cost under carbon cap policy. This model establishes that the plastic reforming industry will get more profit and an optimal level of circularity index when it works with high efficiency of emission and waste minimization technologies under low investment, a rise in the carbon tax, and less opportunity cost. Sensitivity analysis and managerial framework in the plastic reforming industry were given to realize the sensitivity of decision variables with variation in key parameters.\",\n",

Surface pretreatment was observed that has an obviously negative effect on the floating ratio of polycarbonate and the floating ratio of poly-methyl-methacrylate, polystyrene, and polyvinylchloride was not affected in flotation, and this difference in floating ratio can be expected to separate polycarbonate from plastic mixtures. The optimum conditions obtained included sodium hypochlorite concentration of 0.05\\u202fM, pretreatment temperature of 70.0\\u202f°C, pretreatment time of 60.0\\u202fmin, frother dosage of 10.8\\u202fmg/L, and flotation time of 4.0\\u202fmin. Under optimum conditions, polycarbonate was separated effectively from multiple plastic mixtures, and the purity and recovery were 99.8% and 100.0%, respectively. The major mechanism of surface pretreatment was ascertained by the aid of Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the hydrophilic groups, pitting, and protuberances introduced on polycarbonate surface caused the reduced floating ratio of polycarbonate. Accordingly, this method can be expected to improve the recycling quality of waste plastics, and provides technological insights in the environmentally friendly disposal of waste plastics.',\n",

The aim of both adding a compatibilizer and applying high-energy electron radiation, with doses of up to 300kGy, to the blends was to enhance their mechanical properties and, at the same time, to investigate the possibility of using these procedures for recycling plastic waste. As compatibilizers, styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate (TMPTA) were utilised. They were added in the amounts of 10 and 1wt%, respectively. It was found that SEBS-g-MA and PS were thermodynamically immiscible with the remaining components of the composites at temperatures ranging from −20 to +150°C, and that both the addition of TMPTA and the application of the electron radiation insignificantly affected the phase transition temperatures and the loss factor. On the other hand, a significant increase in the tan δ values upon the addition of SEBS-g-MA and/or rise in temperature were observed.',\n",

       " {'context': '               New industrial products or invention made from recycled material had become major attraction in order to save the environment and cost as well. An attempt to make a plastic base industrial product from a blend of recycled clothes and polypropylene nanoclay had been discussed in this article. Basically, some of the clothes originated from polymer was recycled as filler material for a compound for injection molding process. The process started by shredding the used clothes into a powder and mix it with polypropylene-nanoclay nanocomposites. Three colors of recycled clothes were chosen which are red, blue and yellow. All samples produced from this process went to several testing such as tensile, warpage, and shrinkage. Based on the results of tensile test, the highest average Young’s Modulus value with the 502.104 MPa for 3% of recycled fiber from recycled clothes. Furthermore, the Young’s Modulus value for polypropylene- nanoclay without fiber was lowest as compared with other samples. The value of average shrinkage is 0.01482 mm. From the result also showed that the average warpage was 0.0332 mm. Based on the analysis, it can be assumed that the product of recycled clothes/polypropylene/nanoclay have a stable shrinkage but variation of warpage values. Hence, more focus was needed to control the warpage value to reduce this defect during manufacturing process. The outcome of this research should be beneficial in the future of plastic manufacturing process, in terms reducing cost of raw material and at the same time, the environmental pollution impact also can be reduced.

The proposed integrated MCDM framework includes the Shannon Entropy (SE), Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and, ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) systems in an intelligent way. Through decision-making computations, all criteria are approved after extraction from the literature review by experts with more than 60% agreement percentage. Different scenarios of economic, energy, and environmental crises are created. One finding of this paper is to propose a new entrance in economic competition with plastic biodegradation to present a novel, environmental-friendly product with high-quality and low-cost advantages. Another finding determines that with an application of plastic wastes bio-recovery, citizens' satisfaction from urban management system will be increased from 49% to 64%. Whereas, based on the outcomes of this investigation, the rate of municipal waste industries development, smart city goals’ meeting, and rate of hazardous material emission from municipal solid wastes are increased to 58%, 25%, and 70%, respectively.

       " {'context': 'Carbon nanotube (CNT), has been demonstrated as a promising high-value product from thermal chemical conversion of waste plastics and securing new applications is an important prerequisite for large-scale production of CNT from waste-plastic recycling. In this study, CNT, produced from waste plastic through chemical vapor deposition (pCNT), was applied as a nanofiller in phase change material (PCM), affording pCNT-PCM composites. Compared with pure PCM, the addition of 5.0 wt% pCNT rendered the peak melting temperature increase by 1.3 ℃, latent heat retain by 90.7%, and thermal conductivity increase by 104%. The results of morphological analysis and leakage testing confirmed that pCNT has similar PCM encapsulation performance and shape stability to those of commercial CNT. The formation of uniform pCNT cluster networks allowed for a large CNT loading into the PCM on the premise of free phase change, responsible for the high thermal conductivity inside the homogeneous phase. Thus, the resulting capillary forces retained a high latent heat capacity and suitable melting temperature and prohibited PCM leakage from the matrix to the outside during re-melting as the pCNT loading ratio increased. Therefore, the as-prepared pCNT-PCM composite is believed to have similar potential to cCNT and shows prominent performance as a flowable conductive filler for battery thermal management systems.',\n",

It's conducted by conventional heating, solar heating, and microwave-controlled heating. Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis is more advantageous. The temperature distribution, mass transfer, and heat transfer rates depend on the operation mode through process parameters. The optimization of the pyrolysis process is crucial for scale-up. Computer-assisted modeling and simulation techniques help to develop suitable configurations and experimental methods for better efficiencies. Modeling allows the identification of optimum operating parameters and understanding of transportation mechanisms involved in pyrolysis.

In the city of Johannesburg for example, informal waste pickers have now become part of the waste management landscape and are involved in municipal waste collection, sorting and recycling of economically viable recyclable materials such as paper, Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and ferrous metals. Using empirical data collected through the tradition of participatory research, the findings suggest that waste pickers play a vital role in municipal solid waste management and make a significant contribution to the city's economic growth as well as environmental wellness. Despite their contribution, the findings also suggest that, the institutional and policy framework in Johannesburg has continued to not positively integrate the informal sector into the formal systems of solid waste. It is therefore, suggested in the paper that for the city of Johannesburg to effectively and efficiently manage solid waste, it is important that the city managers look for avenues through which they can integrate the two systems of solid waste practices prevalent in the city.

Due to the highly improved melt properties, the possible application profile is extended and not only a “re-cycling” process, even a real “up-cycling” is presented. The used PP was collected from commingled household polyolefin waste, which contained different types of PP and macromolecular impurities such as 10% of polyethylene with high density (PE-HD). In addition, a single PP waste fraction from cleaned beverage and yoghurt cups was manually sorted. The up-cycled PP from single polymer waste, as well as the post-consumer blend, showed pronounced strain hardening and increased melt strength, which was comparable to LCB-PP prepared from virgin PP. However, the up-cycled post-consumer blend showed weaker mechanical performance especially low elongation at break due to PE-HD.',\n",

Microplastics (MPs) could accumulate RhB in the aquatic environment, increasing their potential environmental risks. In this study, the interaction between RhB and MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) were thoroughly investigated, and the effects of pH, salinity, humic acid, particle size, and temperature were explored. The adsorption capacity of RhB on MPs followed the order PVC > PS > PET. The pH significantly influenced the adsorption of RhB on MPs. The presence of Na + and humic acid could compete with RhB for adsorption sites. High temperature promoted the adsorption of RhB on PVC but inhibited that of PS and PET. The adsorption process could be well described by the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, indicating that the adsorption was monolayer chemisorption. The adsorption capacity of RhB varies with MPs depended on the specific surface area, crystallinity, glassy state, and functional groups of MPs. Electrostatic interaction was a crucial factor in the adsorption of RhB on MPs. The adsorption of RhB on PVC was affected by halogen bonding and polar interaction. PS and PET could be combined with RhB through π – π interaction. This study explored the adsorption characteristics of diverse MPs to RhB and provided a theoretical basis for assessing its potential environmental risks.',\n",

Thus the disposal of waste PS is an inevitably worldwide issue because of their stable and non-biodegradable nature. Herein, a facile method was proposed to carbonize PS waste into novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous carbon using Fe2O3 particles as both catalyst and template. Furthermore, KOH activation was applied to generate microporous and mesopores on the wall of macropores. As a result, the obtained 3D hierarchically porous carbon exhibits a high specific capacitance of 284.1 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good rate performance of 198 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 in a three-electrode device. Moreover, the assembled symmetrical capacitor displays a high energy density of 19.2 W h kg−1 at the power density of 200.7 W kg−1 in aqueous electrolyte. Therefore, the present research develops a sustainable way to recycle waste plastics into 3D hierarchically porous carbon for supercapacitors.',\n",

The effects of these ratios in these 3D LDH constructions on physicochemical properties were investigated using XRD, SEM, VSM, UV–vis, and BET analyses. The specific surface area and band gap of these materials decreased with increased ratio, while the saturation magnetization increased. The synergistic combination of saturation magnetization, adsorption characteristics, and band gap of six sample types were evaluated. S3 samples were used in a multistage recycling treatment study of dye wastewater and fluoride ion (F − )-containing wastewater, effectively degrading methyl orange (MO) due to its high photocatalytic activity. After this, the memory effect of the calcined product (S3, 300 °C) significantly enhanced the migration and diffusion of F − , resulting in a F − adsorption capacity of 49.25 mg/g. The recycling properties of this composite material for photocatalytic degradation and adsorption capabilities for F − removal were evaluated, showing a reduction in efficiency of only 1 % and 8.6 % for degradation of MO and F − removal respectively, with no significant loss of efficiency after 10 cycles. Adsorption experiments and subsequent sample characterization showed that the F − adsorption mechanism of S3 involved ion exchange mechanism and sorption sites (interlayer, basal, edges and junction sites). The existence of oxygen vacancies and formation of S-scheme heterojunction between γ-Fe2O3-Cd2+-Ni2+-Fe3+-LDH and Ni2+-Al3+-LDH, resulted in the improvement of the photocatalytic activity. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that Ni2+-Al3+-LDH/γ-Fe2O3 -Cd2+-Ni2+-Fe3+-LDH composites were a promising adsorbent for degradation of MO and F − removal in practical multilevel utilization due to its simple synthesis, low-cost, recyclability, and high removal capability.',\n",

Metal chloride as Lewis acid catalyst has excellent catalytic performance in enormous organic reaction. However, the high solubility of the metal chloride in ethylene glycol and the residue of metal ions in the product will have an adverse impact on the subsequent process. In this work, polymer ionic liquid containing [NTf2]− which is insoluble in ethylene glycol at room temperature was synthesized and used to immobilize metal ions to catalyze glycolysis of PET. After reaction, the polymer ionic liquid-metal ion catalyst could be recovered at room temperature by simple filtration. PET conversion reached 95.4% and BHET yield reached 77.8% using PIL-Zn2+ as catalyst at 195 °C for 120 min. Ionic liquid was characterized by FT-IR, NMR and ESI-MS. Interaction between ionic liquid and metal ions was characterized by FT-IR. The interaction energy of polymer ionic liquid-metal ion complex is higher than that of ethylene glycol-metal ion complex by DFT calculation (Density functional calculation). The both content of metal ion in polymer ionic liquid-metal ion complex and catalytic performance of as-synthesized catalysts did not obviously decrease after the catalyst was reused for five times. This work mainly provided a way of recovering catalyst and promote development of glycolysis of PET.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper reviews studies of the environmental impact of textile reuse and recycling, to provide a summary of the current knowledge and point out areas for further research. Forty-one studies were reviewed, whereof 85% deal with recycling and 41% with reuse (27% cover both reuse and recycling). Fibre recycling is the most studied recycling type (57%), followed by polymer/oligomer recycling (37%), monomer recycling (29%), and fabric recycling (14%). Cotton (76%) and polyester (63%) are the most studied materials. The reviewed publications provide strong support for claims that textile reuse and recycling in general reduce environmental impact compared to incineration and landfilling, and that reuse is more beneficial than recycling. The studies do, however, expose scenarios under which reuse and recycling are not beneficial for certain environmental impacts. For example, as benefits mainly arise due to the avoided production of new products, benefits may not occur in cases with low replacement rates or if the avoided production processes are relatively clean. Also, for reuse, induced customer transport may cause environmental impact that exceeds the benefits of avoided production, unless the use phase is sufficiently extended. In terms of critical methodological assumptions, authors most often assume that textiles sent to recycling are wastes free of environmental burden, and that reused products and products made from recycled materials replace products made from virgin fibres. Examples of other content mapped in the review are: trends of publications over time, common aims and geographical scopes, commonly included and omitted impact categories, available sources of primary inventory data, knowledge gaps and future research needs. The latter include the need to study cascade systems, to explore the potential of combining various reuse and recycling routes.',\n",

In this paper, through experiments, we compare properties of pyrolysis oil derived from after use HDPE (High-density polyethylene), LDPE (Low-density polyethylene), PP (Polypropylene)and styrene for their suitability as diesel engine fuel. This experimental study is to identify which type of plastic is suitable for blending with diesel. The physicochemical properties of pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene were tested, tabulated and compared with diesel. The physicochemical properties of polypropylene pyrolysis oil (PPO) were found to be superior to the produced pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, and styrene. The GC-MS(Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)and FT-IR (Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy) were taken for pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene and compared with diesel. PPO showed lower carbon number chain compounds compared to the other three waste plastics. We selected PPO for diesel engine performance and emission trials based on the results of the above tests. PPO was blended in the ratios of 5%, 10% and 15% with diesel. Combustion analysis showed a increase in cylinder pressure in comparison to diesel values. The heat release rates (HRR) were sharply higher than diesel. Both cylinder pressure and HRRvalues for PPO increased as the blend ratios increased. The emission results showed an increase in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC)and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)emissions. The multiple times increase in emissions is due to the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons and higher carbon number of saturated compounds in PPO. GC-MS tests confirmed the presence of such compounds in PPO. To reduce the unsaturation to negligible levels, we will take up future experiments in hydrogenating PPO with various catalysts and test the performance and emissions in diesel engines.',\n",

Almost the entire amount of rubber from the worn out tires is discarded, which again need very long time for natural degradation due to crosslinked structure of rubbers and presence of stabilizers and other additives. This poses two major problems: the wastage of valuable rubber and the disposal of waste tires leading to environmental pollution. Two major approaches to solve this problem are the recycle and the reuse of used and waste rubber, and the reclaim of rubber raw materials.',\n",

There is some strength loss of the beam mainly attributed to the degradation take place in compressive strength of concrete, but mode of failure of tested concrete beams was almost identical to that of control beam without PET waste fiber.

       " {'context': 'Plastic debris is an ever-growing concern adversely affecting the coastal and marine ecosystem. Among marine plastic waste, a particularly troublesome waste fraction is Abandoned, Lost or Discarded Fishing Gears (ALDFG) that continues to trap marine life for years upon releaseand has significant adverse environmental effects on coastal and marine ecosystems. However, lack of scientific data on the estimated contribution of ALDFG to marine plastics and associated reasoning hinders the management of fishing gear resources across the globe. This study presents a system-wide analysis of the typical fishing gears used in Norway for commercial fishing, i.e. trawls, seines (Danish and Purse), longlines, gillnets, and traps. Based on data from gear producers, suppliers, fishers, collectors, authorities, and waste management facilities, we model the flows of plastics polymers, polypropylene, polyethylene, and Nylon, used as the building blocks of advanced gears. A static Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is used to understand life cycle processes and further monitor gear quantities in and between the processes in the system. Our findings indicate that commercial fishing in Norway contributes to around 380t/yr. mass of plastics from lost fishing gears and parts. Gillnets, longlines, and traps are the main contributors to ALDFG in the ocean due to gear design, practice, and ground deployment. Additionally, around 4000tons of plastic waste is collected in Norway annually from derelict fishing gears out of which 24% is landfilled, and 21% is incinerated for energy recovery. The MFA approach shows significant potential as a holistic decision support tool for industry and policy-makers in exercising sustainable fishing gear resource management. The study also generates key evidence on regional level plastic pollution from the fishing sector and highlights possible mechanisms that may aid in proposed improvements.',\n",

The HDPE and LDPE were collected from household waste and after manual segregation, different particle size (i.e., single particle size (SPS), double particle size (DPS), and triple particle size (TPS) in different proportions) of SiC/Al2O3 were added independently to HDPE and LDPE. The melt flow index (MFI) of these combinations/proportions was computed as per ASTM D1238-73 standard. After evaluation of MFIs, the best combinations were selected and used for filament wire preparation on twin screw extruder. The output properties, i.e., peak strength, break strength, peak elongation, break elongation, etc. were modeled for multi factor optimization. The filament wires was made to run on commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) three dimensional printer (open source) for preparation of cylindrical pins (selected as RT) for wear testing. These pins were made to run on pin on disk apparatus for ascertaining the wear properties.

Four different replacement levels of plastic waste were selected for analysis - 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% by weight of gypsum. The first stage of the experimental campaign consisted of analysing the resulting composites based on density, mechanical performance (flexural and compressive strength) and surface hardness (Shore C). In the second stage, samples were evaluated based on their water absorption by capillary action or exposing them to continuous moisture in a wet chamber, and water resistance by subjecting them to several wetting-drying cycles. After that, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were carried out to evaluate the quality of the cohesion at the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the PP waste particles and the gypsum matrix. The results showed equivalent compressive strength and even a slight improvement (up to ∼9% when using 2.5% of PP waste when compared to the control material) most likely due to the greater compactness from the improved particle size distribution. In addition, a considerable reduction in water absorption and retention capacity was observed, due to the increasing incorporation of recycled PP into the gypsum matrix. The new PP-containing composites subjected to water absorption by capillary action and continuous moisture tests presented lower water absorption and adsorption capacity, wherein specimens with 10% of PP waste showed a decline of up to ∼37% when compared to the reference material. It was generally observed that the waste material can be considered as a viable partial substitute to the current commercial gypsum for the production of gypsum plasterboards.',\n",

The effects of various parameters on the floatability of the used plastics, namely, chemical agent type and concentration, conditioning temperature and time and liquid media pH, were studied and the results were discussed. It revealed that in most experiments, the PET sustained the least flotation change for the studied chemical agents and was sunk at the bottom of the flotation tank. The TA was useful on the PVC flotation through surface adsorption and changing the PVC surface hydrophobic behavior in different ways depending on the TA concentration. With the PET exception, the increasing temperature improved floatability of the studied plastics for used chemical agents. The raising the pH of the liquid media changed the floatability of the studied plastics in different ways depending on the pH value and the used chemical agent. In most cases, the increasing conditioning time was beneficial to the plastic flotation up to 15\\u202fmin. As an essential conclusion, the PVC and PS could be separated from PET in their mixture by using TA-PEG with 0.2–0.8 ratio and TA-PEG with equal ratio plus 2\\u202fml/L MIBC in two stages completely. The comparison of the results with other studies showed the shape and size of the used plastics were crucial factors on the separation of the studied plastics by the flotation technique.',\n",

Bio-based building materials may be a solution for this problem, as they combine re-use and recycling abilities together with hygroscopic characteristics, leading to buildings energy savings. For the first time, the dynamic response to hygrothermal changes of bio-based materials is examined in terms of Moisture Buffering Value (MBV), dry/wet thermal conductivity, microstructure, density and latent heat through daily cycles. It is shown that MBV is a useful tool for characterisation but needs to be combined with the shape of the change in mass of the final hygrothermal cycle. Mastering this is required to obtain significant improved indoor environment quality in buildings. Ten samples of bio-based insulation materials and one thermoplastic recycled polymer were analysed (wool, hemp, saw mill residue, wood, straw, cork and polyethylene terephthalate). Saw and wool are the most promising, as materials exhibit dynamic response to hygrothermal changes. Only half the amount of samples revealed equivalent efficient moisture transfer to be able to desorb the adsorbed quantity of water. Latent heat of vaporisation and condensation tests led to the conclusion that samples of wool and saw mill residue can qualify as bio-based materials for ‘green’ panels.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Cooperatives of recyclable material scavengers make the tasks of scavenging, storage, processing, and marketing recyclable solid waste economically viable for their associates. However, the residues collected by these cooperatives are sold to middlemen, who process the material and resell it to the transformation industry. Thus, the lack of processing of the material collected by the cooperatives, such as grinding of plastics, results in the loss of up to 75% of the aggregated value of the recycled products. A solution to add value to recycled material is the implementation of a plastic processing center (PPC). Subsequently, the use of cooperative networks is necessary because the minimum daily flow of plastic material required to operate a PPC makes investment for implementation by a single cooperative infeasible. To aid cooperatives and the representatives of government programs that support cooperatives in choosing a city to implement a PPC, this study proposes a method for selecting the installation location of a PPC based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach using social, economic, environmental, and public policy aspects. The method was applied to a network of cooperatives participating in a federal government program located in cities in the western region of the state of Parana, Brazil. Various scenarios were explored regarding preferences/weights assigned by the decision-maker to the criteria and sub-criteria for decision-making. The sub-criteria with the greatest roles in decision-making were payment for the service provided and restrictive municipal legislation; according to the decision-maker, this legislation represents the view of the municipal government regarding cooperatives. The secretariat of social action is responsible for monitoring cooperatives, and there is no compensation for scavenging performed in the city; this scenario does not apply to companies responsible for the selective collection of solid waste, which are accompanied by the secretary of the environment.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper compares the combustion of selected artificial polymers and biomasses in a fluidized bed reactor. Two types of the artificial polymers were tested. The first one was used in packaging: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene. The second one included construction polymers: polyamide, polycarbonate, copolymer acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and polyvinyl chloride. For comparison the combustion of the biomasses in the form of processed briquettes and pellets as well as beech and pine wood samples was also presented. The tests were carried out in a bubble fluidized bed built of quartz sand (granulation 0.385–0.43 mm). In the first part of the research, the samples of polymers and biomasses were burned in the presence of gaseous fuel at a bed temperature of approximately 850°C. In the second part, after heating the bed to a temperature of approximately 900°C, the supply of gaseous fuel was closed. The samples were dosed when the bed was fluidized only with air. It has been found that the combustion times for packaging and construction materials (samples: 0.1–1.8 g) were similar (T = 10.8 s), except for the polyvinyl chloride and polyamide samples whose combustion time was twice as long. The time of combustion of the biomass particles depended strongly on the sample mass rather than its type, which was of less importance. The presence of radicals resulting from liquefied petroleum gas combustion influenced the process of carbon chain fragmentation, thus shortening the time of combustion of polymers in comparison to the tests carried out without a gaseous supporting fuel. The combustion of polymers and biomasses was accompanied by the release of pyrolytic gases which, after mixing with oxidiser, ignited in regular time intervals, with frequencies 2 and 1.1 Hz. The general scheme of sequence of events making up the dynamics of the process was presented.',\n",

Laboratory tests performed on polysaccharide films and biocomposites based sheets prepared with the same materials developed for preparing the pots, were carried out in order to understand the chemico-physical correlations between resin, ionic crosslinking agent, reinforcing fibres and water. To this aim, mechanical tests, water vapour permeability tests, water up-take evaluations and morphological analysis were carried out. It was found a strong physical interaction between sodium alginate and calcium ions in the development of a three-dimensional network. The crosslinked structure was able to physically entrap the reinforcement fibres by means of hydrogen bonding, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. SEM analysis performed on fracture surfaces of the biocomposites evidenced that the fibres were well embedded inside the three-dimensional network, even if their dispersion needed some improvements; EDS analysis revealed the presence of calcium in rather all the selected internal micro-zones, thus suggesting a well structured network. In order to assess the agronomic performance of the novel biodegradable pots in seedling transplanting activity, the pots were tested in real field condition during 2009 at the experimental farm of the University of Bari, Italy. From the analysis of the young plants transplanted in the field, it was inferred that the biodegradable containers had enhanced the roots plants development and the plant growing, avoiding transplant shock and root deformation. After the using time, they completely degraded into the soil within 2 weeks.',\n",

       " {'context': '               Poor waste management and detoxification techniques lead to chemical, physical and microbiological risks to the people who come in their direct/indirect contact, increasing the ecotoxicity of the environment. The term ‘biomedical waste’ denotes any type of medical waste which is produced through diagnosis or medication, through vaccination or surgery of human beings or animals. Such wastes may also be produced by research activities and in the production or testing of biological products. About 80% of medical waste is believed to be a non-risk waste or general health care waste, whereas the remaining 20% is hazardous leading to the development of a variety of health threats. Based on their sources, medical wastes are classified into three different categories including clinical waste, non-clinical waste, and laboratory waste. The treatment and detoxification of waste is a critical step before the removal of the waste from the generation source to avoid any contamination during transportation followed by post-separation, where the waste is carried to the site of disposal treatment. The color and hazardous/nonhazardous sign on the packaging bag of the waste determines the fate of waste and its disposal mechanism. Several wates, even after treatment do not degrade to a large extent and pose the threat of biomagnification and bioamplification in the natural resources. The degradation of such waste is tough and complex physical and chemical methods are employed to do so, doing more harm than benefit to the environment. Therefore, microbial degradation has come up as a sustainable and effective measure to treat waste including plastics, human anatomical waste, laboratory waste, discarded drugs and medicines, contaminated water, and chemical wastes. It is however noteworthy that, none of the practices or methods employed for the treatment of medical waste can ensure sustainable methods, and hence, the only way to manage the waste problem efficiently is to generate less waste. In this chapter, we shall discuss the types, disposal, and biodegradation of medical wastes and the future development in waste management.            ',\n",

       " {'context': \"The application of recycled tire rubber (TCR) in concrete replacing conventional aggregates offers high recycling potential. However, the poor bonding between the hydrophobic rubber particles and the cement matrix weakens the material's mechanical properties. This study investigated the combined effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and TCR on the mechanical properties of concrete, as well as microstructure characteristics. The different CNTs, surfactants, and ultrasonic dispersion time were subjected to a screening procedure in cement paste. Concrete production and mechanical performance tests are carried out after obtaining the above parameters. The results show that the improvement of the compressive strength of concrete by CNTs is negatively correlated with the content of TCR. The reinforcement behavior of CNTs has no subordinate properties among compressive strength, flexural strength, and splitting tensile strength. The morphological characteristics of CNTs-reinforced crumb rubber concrete (CNTCRC) revealed that CNTs refined the micropores as fillers. Furthermore, the poor interfacial bonding between TCR and cement matrix together with microcracks was modified due to the bridging effect of CNTs. In addition, the working mechanisms of TCR and CNTs in the cement hydration reaction were conceptually explored to help understand the reinforcing mechanism of CNTs on the macro level.\",\n",

The effect of catalyst concentration, time, and temperature on the depolymerization of PET and yield of TPA were determined with PSSA and H2SO4. The PSSA system exhibited faster hydrolysis kinetics than H2SO4 with a shorter induction period than those often observed for acid hydrolysis of PET. The activation energies for the hydrolysis of PET were 24.8 kJ mol−1 and 29.1 kJ mol−1 for 2 M PSSA and 2 M H2SO4, respectively. The hydrophobic backbone of PSSA improves surface wetting of the catalyst solution at the PET interface, resulting in a higher localized concentration of protons. Contact angle measurements indicated better surface wetting of PET films by the aqueous solutions of PSSA than H2SO4 at equal concentrations. Additionally, the reutilization and titration results indicated that PSSA maintained the activity after reuse for five reaction cycles.',\n",

A closed-loop controller is also developed to automatically regulate screw speed and barrel temperature profile to achieve constant viscosity and enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled HDPE materials. Such a system will improve processability of mixed MFI polymers may also reduce the risk of polymer melt degradation, reduce producing large volumes of scrap/waste and lead to improvement in product quality.

       " {'context': 'The scarcity of sound soils, especially in urban areas, often forces engineers to construct the pavement on problematic subgrade soils such as expansive clays. The associated cost involved in replacing the existing problematic soil is avoided by adopting treatment techniques. In this study, a type of high plasticity expansive clay was mixed with 10, 20, and 30% sand-size recycled glass (RG) as a non-chemical soil treatment approach. An extensive investigation comprising experimental works, numerical modeling, and pavement performance analysis was undertaken. After determination of the physical properties of clay and RG, resilient modulus characteristics of clay and the three clay-RG mixtures were carried out through an experimental program. Subsequently, the obtained resilient modulus data sets were incorporated into a finite element analysis program in order to analyze the stress-strain response of pavement models founded on clay and RG-treated subgrades. The compressive and tensile strains achieved through the analysis of the pavement models under traffic loads were next used to compare each pavement model with respect to fatigue and rutting performances. The experimental results showed up to a 113% increase in resilient modulus of clay by the addition of 30% RG. The outcomes of the analysis on pavement systems modeled using the experimental input showed a considerable reduction in compressive and tensile strains by treating the clay subgrade with RG. Consequently, the strain reduction exhibited a significant increase in fatigue life and rutting life of pavements founded on RG treated clay subgrades. The outcomes of this research aim to encourage the construction industry to consider the utilization of environmentally clean recycled aggregates, such as RG, for improving subgrades with problematic soils and hence, promote sustainable construction materials and approaches.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Greenhouse cultivation in the Mediterranean region has undoubtedly enhanced the economic growth and has generated social benefits by making an efficient use of resources. However, these production systems caused undesirable environmental impacts. In order to move towards cleaner production in greenhouse areas, this study has assessed the potential environmental benefits and trade-offs of the integration of an on-farm reverse osmosis system powered by photovoltaic solar energy to recycle the drainage effluents from greenhouses. To that end, we compare the environmental footprint of a greenhouse tomato crop using this technology in a hydroponic system (HS), versus the conventional sanded soil ‘enarenado’ (CS) with free-drainage to soil. Additionally, for comparison, three independent irrigation sources (desalinated seawater with low electrical conductivity and two different mixes of underground and desalinated water, with moderate and high electrical conductivity, respectively) were evaluated. The use of desalinated seawater can help reduce the overexploitation of aquifers, although if the desalination process is not done with clean energy it also comes with a negative impact on the carbon footprint. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to analyse and evaluate six environmental impact indicators associated with these production systems and water treatments. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the potential environmental benefits of increasing the use of renewable energy for desalinated water production, whilst also curbing the common over-fertilisation malpractice reported in the study area. Based on our findings, the HS with leachate treatment technology showed, compared to the CS system, a significant reduction in the eutrophication (72 %), although it did inevitably increase the depletion of fossil fuels (43 %) global warming (37 %) and acidification (32 %) impacts, due to the need for additional infrastructure and equipment. Among the inputs considered for the cultivation systems, the greenhouse structure, and the production of fertilisers and electricity for fertigation represented the highest environmental burdens. When comparing the three irrigation treatments, it was observed that the partial substitution of desalinated seawater by brackish groundwater substantially mitigated (27 %) the global warming footprint. The sensitivity analysis revealed that a significant reduction in the environmental impact is feasible.',\n",

Additionally, the rich valuable metal resources in the waste solution will not be adequately reused. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more advanced electroplating/electroless plating waste solution treatment technologies.

The principle, advantages and disadvantages, and optimization progress of the treatment technology for electroplating/electroless plating waste solution are summarized from three aspects: simple and direct removal of valuable metal elements, separation and recovery of valuable metal elements, and direct preparation of high-value materials from waste solution. The technical advantages of multi-method combined treatment of waste solution have been analyzed.

       " {'context': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a global emergency and also has raised issues with waste management practices. This study emphasized the challenges of increased waste disposal during the COVID-19 crisis and its response practices. Data obtained from the scientific research papers, publications from the governments and multilateral organizations, and media reports were used to quantify the effect of the pandemic towards waste generation. A huge increase in the amount of used personal protective equipments (facemasks, gloves, and other protective stuffs) and wide distribution of infectious wastes from hospitals, health care facilities, and quarantined households was found. The amount of food and plastic waste also increased during the pandemic. These factors caused waste treatment facilities to be overwhelmed, forcing emergency treatment and disposals (e.g., co-disposal in a municipal solid waste incinerator, cement kilns, industrial furnaces, and deep burial) to ramp up processing capacity. This paper discussed the ways the operation of those facilities must be improved to cope with the challenge of handling medical waste, as well as working around the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The study also highlights the need for short, mid, and longer-term responses towards waste management during the pandemic. Furthermore, the practices discussed in this paper may provide an option for alternative approaches and development of sustainable strategies for mitigating similar pandemics in the future.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Herein, the study conducts an experimental research on the mechanical strength and durability of chopped basalt fiber (BF) reinforced recycled aggregate (RA) concrete. BF at six volumetric dosages of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 1.5% and RA at five volumetric substitution levels of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% are used in determining the compressive strength, the splitting tensile strength, the specific strength [ratio of splitting tensile strength and apparent density] and the chloride penetration. Results show that BF reinforces both RA and nature aggregate (NA) concrete in a dosage dependent way. Relative to the late strength, BF has a better reinforcement effect on the early strength of RA concrete. BF content though is positively related to the splitting tensile strength is with a declined marginal utility. The opitmal dosage thereby exists and is identifed as 1%. Given the reinforcement of BF and the lower density of RA, the combined use of BF at low dosage and RA in high content results in a specific strength that is higher than that of RA concrete. Besides the strength enhancement effect, BF also descends the porosity and ascends the resistance to chloride penetration of RA concrete. The respond surface methodology interestingly is found to have a prominent role in establishing a mathematical model between the compressive and the splitting tensile strength because both strengths have respond surfaces that are shaped by BF and RA. Aforementioned results verify inferior properties of RA concrete can be offset by BF addition, signifying a complementary effect between BF and RA.',\n",

The most widely and extensively used form of plastic is the Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) which is used as a crude material for soft drinks, soda bottles, and many other materials of the daily use. After the usage of the PET bottles, these are very difficult to be disposed off and are mostly dumped or burnt resulting in the degradation of environment. One of the best methods is to use the PET as replacement in concrete. In this paper, the use of PET in the form of fine powder as the replacement of Fine aggregates with the addition of Marble dust is investigated. The impact of using crushed PET as fine aggregate replacement in concrete and its effect on the strength of concrete has been studied. Different percentages of PET 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% as fine aggregate replacement with the addition of 2% marble dust as an additive was used. Particle size distribution test and specific gravity test was also conducted on PET aggregates. The fresh and hardened concrete tests such as Workability test, compression test, flexural test and split tensile test were also carried out on cube, beams and cylinders. The test results showed that the strength of the specimens increased at 8% of PET replacement with 2% marble additives compared to the normal specimens at different curing ages. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were also carried out to determine the nature and shape of PET molecules.',\n",

Morphologies and mechanical properties of handsheets were thoroughly investigated by whiteness index, brightness%, breaking length, tear index, bursting index, FTIR spectroscopy, optical microscope, and scanning electron microscope. Based on detailed observations, it is summarized that the produced handsheets, depending on the chemical treatment and blend ratio with HWKP, possess variations in appearances and properties that will have a wide range of potential applications from newsprint, tissue paper to commercial-grade writing and printing papers.',\n",

It is noted that most existing UHPCCs are manufactured from raw materials with high quality, for instance, well-graded river sands. However, the huge consumption of river sands as construction materials has inevitably resulted in some serious ecological impacts, as reported around the world. In this regard, it shall be much beneficial if some substitutes, such as recycled sands produced through processing of construction and demolition waste (CDW), could be used to replace natural sands to manufacture the qualified UHPCCs. This paper presents such a preliminary study on the feasibility of manufacturing UHPCCs with recycled sands. A total of five UHPCCs are designed and cast with different replacement percentages of recycled sand, i.e., 0%, 30% 50%, 70% and 100% (in mass). The associated packing density of the mixed sands is estimated based on the linear packing model. The fresh and hardened properties of the UHPCCs, including the workability, strength and shrinkage, are experimentally examined. The test results indicate that it is possible to use recycled sand to replace natural river sand in the manufacture of UHPCCs; however, the amount of the recycled sand needs to be limited. In the case when the replacement percentage of the recycled sand is lower than 50% (in mass), the properties of the UHPCCs with the recycled sand are comparable with those containing river sand only.',\n",

The heating rates of TG and Py-GC/MS were the same for each group of experiments. In addition, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of WPCBs polymer monomers was calculated by DFT method. Compared with slow pyrolysis, the final weight loss of fast pyrolysis is reduced by 0.76 wt%. The kinetic analysis indicates that the activation energies of main pyrolysis stages range from 98.29 kJ/mol to 177.59 kJ/mol. The volatile products of fast pyrolysis are mainly phenols and aromatics. With the increase of multi-step pyrolysis temperature, the order of the escaping volatiles is phenols, hydrocarbyl phenols, aromatics, and benzene (or diphenyl phenol). The pyrolysis residue of WPCBs may contains phenolics and polymers. Based on the free radical reactions, the mechanism and reaction pathways of WPCBs pyrolysis were deduced by the DFT.

The advanced physical techniques are introduced briefly at firstly. Additionally, evaluate on chemical method for plastic decomposition and review on biotic degradation of plastic. The reactive oxygen species and the enzymes play a crucial role in chemical and biotic degradation processes, respectively. The reactive oxygen species are derived from the activated state of oxides, and the enzymes that aid the microorganism to ingest plastic through its metabolic mechanism are secreted by the microorganism. Subsequently, the potential possibility of upcycling plastic is analyzed from two aspects of the technology and application. The innovative technology utilizes sunlight as driver-power of plastic upcycling. And the carbon capture, utilization and sequestration and the growth substrate provided the novel guided directions for plastic recycle. Lastly, the three suggestions on plastic waste management are expected to establish an economy and efficient plastic sorting system, and two engineering solutions on plastic recycle are to make a contribution for sustainable upcycling of plastic.',\n",

       " {'context': '               Selection and implementation of effective and efficient waste management strategies have been widely considered as a matter of concern for sustainable development. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the most common approach to evaluate the environmental impacts of different waste management strategies. This article presents a systematic review of scientific LCA studies assessing environmental impacts of waste to energy (WtE) technologies. A systematic literature review protocol was followed to characterize and critically evaluate the published literature on the environmental dimensions of LCA studies for WtE from 1981 to 2019 in terms of software, databases, life cycle impact assessment methods, environmental impacts and source of uncertainty. The major research observations were summarized accordingly, and important insights were obtained in the current review. The results showed that the treatment of specific waste material with various WtE technologies can affect different environmental impact categories in a contradictory way. There was a general agreement in the results about the preference of incineration over landfilling for MSW treatment. Moreover, the results of sensitivity analysis showed that assumptions in substitution of WtE products are the primary source of uncertainty. Overall, the results of LCA studies confirm the application of WtE technologies in an integrated waste management strategy. In addition, the discussion in the article provides insights on technologies suitable for each waste material.            ',\n",

       " {'context': 'Cables and wires are the indispensable parts of electronic equipments for transmission of both information and electricity. Nowadays, data cables are widely used in the computer equipments for sending information and they become waste once its life cycle is completed. However, recycling of cables and wires are mainly concentrating into the recovery of metals such as aluminium and copper, rather than other polymer present. Polymeric materials from the waste data cables are often disposed into landfills or incinerated, since they have only lower value in recycling yard. From the data cables collected, it has been estimated that the major constituents are copper (58.3%), polyvinyl chloride (19.9%) and polyethylene (16%). Similarly, polycarbonate (2.9%), silicon rubber (1.6%), steel (1.4%) and other material (0.4%) such as cotton cord were also present as minor components. Out of these, polyvinyl chloride is the dominant polymer present in data cables. Hence, the present work investigates the reprocessability of the polyvinyl chloride recovered from the data cables and deals with issues such as premature degradation during life cycle, assessment of plasticizers and degradation after reprocessing. Torque measurement studies using torque rheometer revealed further mechanical recycling possibilites of the recovered polyvinyl chloride. Besides, the applicability of melt blending technique for processing recovered polyvinyl chloride can be found out by analysing thermal behaviour by using thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and heat distortion temperature.',\n",

This study is focused on the use of PET as Fibres cut from waste drinking bottles in concrete. Long strips and Short PET fibres cut it from waste beverage bottles were used in self-compacting reinforced concrete (SCRC) beams as reinforcement. Together with the steel reinforcement in beams, the PET strips or fibres were used with, and without shear reinforcement. In SCRC beams detailed for the flexural and shear failure, the 1 percent volume fraction of short strips or fibres were used. Material properties such as compressive strength, elastic modulus were performed along with the beams tested under four-point bending. The results were analysed and compared with strips or fibres reinforced beams with a control beam. Based on the results, it was found that PET bottles as strips or fibres could be used as shear and flexural reinforcement in concrete as enhance in ductility, load capacity and shift of mode of failure were observed with strips and fibres.',\n",

The purpose of both applying the high-energy electron radiation with doses of up to 300kGy and adding a compatibilizer to the blends was to enhance impact strength of the studied composites and, at the same time, to investigate the possibility of using this method in the processing of recycling plastic waste. Styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate (TMPTA) were used as the compatibilizers, added at 10 and 1wt %, respectively. It was found that, under the influence of SEBS-g-MA, the values of σ c and σ t for the studied composites increased by over three and almost five times, respectively. On the other hand, the electron radiation and TMPTA had no noticeable effect on these quantities, which might be due to the protective properties of aromatic rings included in the macromolecules of PS and PET. The study also showed that the inclusion of SEBS-g-MA enabled achievement of satisfactory impact strength of composites made of recycled polyolefins, PS and PET, while it was not necessary to use the electron radiation and TMPTA.',\n",

Results indicated that the specific activities of PET hydrolases purified by heating were generally as competitive as the ones purified by conventional nickel column methods, with higher protein recovery and enzyme activity recovery. The practical application of the heating purified PET hydrolases was further evaluated. Except for ThcCut2, other PET hydrolases exhibited better degradation performances of PET nanoparticles. The novel heating purification method for PET hydrolases showed good applicability, which can be extended to purify other thermo-resistant enzymes.',\n",

To date, material utilisation of wood waste has been limited to particleboard production, with additional niche alternatives being restricted by quality requirements for wood waste. In this consequential life cycle assessment focusing on post-consumer wood collected at Danish recycling centres, Global Warming Potential (GWP) impacts from quality-driven choices for cascading management of wood waste were compared with those from handling mixed wood waste qualities. GWPs were modelled by considering the dynamic profile of greenhouse gas emissions (including biogenic carbon dioxide) for two time horizons (100 and 500\\u202fyears). The robustness of the results was tested by varying modelling assumptions with respect to electricity system, wood sourcing and associated rotation period, and impacts from indirect land use changes. The results demonstrated that valuing quality over quantity in wood waste management can ensure larger GWP savings, especially if recycling applications have a long lifetime and/or substitute energy-intensive products; such results were confirmed under all scenario analyses. Inclusion of land use changes credited land-intensive products. More cascade steps of the wood waste resource ensured larger savings; however, assumptions on the electricity mix, on the source of the wood alongside the choice of the time horizon for GWP greatly influenced the results on cascading management.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'This study aimed to thermally recycle polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a microbial polyester with low thermal stability and limited re-processability, into crotonate-ended oligomers through the E1cB-elimination pathway. The resulting products were used as a functional additive to improve the mechanical and rheological properties of polylactide (PLA), which has intrinsic brittleness and low melt stability. The PLA was modified through a reactive blending process in an internal mixer. The quantitative 1H NMR analysis confirmed the crotonate functionality of the oligomers and their consumption during the reactive blending process. Tensile testing revealed that reactive blending 20 wt% PHB oligomers with PLA improve tensile toughness 24 times over pure PLA while keeping the elastic modulus above 1 GPa. Oscillatory-shear rheometry confirmed the improved shear-thinning behavior of reactive blends, while extensional viscosity measurements revealed a significant strain hardening behavior. The increase in melt stability was attributed to the formation of high molecular weight structures as a result of possible chain extension and branching reactions. DSC traces showed that branching and grafting points acted as nucleation sites, accelerating PLA melt crystallization. It was also found that increasing the PLA crystallinity above 44% gives rise to crystallization-induced phase separation, despite initial miscibility.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The construction industry is a key sector behind the climate change. Not only does it produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, but also absorbs tons of natural aggregates irreversibly. Therefore, this study proposes an alternative approach to the climate change problem by producing a cement-glass composite brick (CGCB) with a printed internal scaffold from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PET-G). This novel construction material, which consists of about 75% of waste glass and 10% of recycled PET-G scaffolding, has a great potential for tackling this problem. The filling mixture itself – cement-glass mortar (CGM) – and ready-made bricks with an internal PET-G scaffolding (3Dhon structure) were tested to verify the accuracy of the assumptions. The scope of this study included mechanical and thermal tests to indicate the properties of the newly manufactured material. The analysis of the results showed that the final CGCB with 3D printed PET-G scaffolding has better thermal properties than CGM as thermal diffusivity (8%) and decreased specific heat (10%). Additionally, significantly reduced flexural strength and compressive strength has been observed (about 30% of both factors) with almost 100% larger strain during compression testing.',\n",

Understanding the tradeoffs in processing end-of-life E-waste materials for reuse is an important part of informing decision-makers who are considering recovery and recycle of these materials. An example study presented here is the recovery and recycle of rare earth metals in the light emitting diodes (LED) found in the backlighting unit for liquid crystal displays (LCD) of flat panel televisions. A conceptual and defined commercial-scale process for recycling E-waste is described, including the recycle of rare earth elements from the LED module. Synthesis of a full process, from display dismantling to rare earth separation, is proposed based on engineering principles and fragmented literature. The synthesis defines a process flow diagram, complete with mass and energy transfer modeling. Such a detailed commercial scale process model for recycling rare earth elements provides an advance to the science. Rare earth elements are critically important, but are low-quantity materials in many electronic items. Providing a process model for their recycle is an essential first step towards a sustainability analysis, with social, economic, and environmental implications.',\n",

Since fire is one of the most common disaster in modern high-rise buildings, the strength, deformation and bearing capacity of recycled concrete structures under high temperatures should be carefully studied in design. The mechanical performances of RACs exposed to high temperatures under biaxial compressive actions have been studied in this research. The RAC specimens with three replacement rates (0%, 50%, 100%) exposed to high temperatures (200 °C, 400 °C) have been tested. The influences of stress ratios, replacement rates and high temperatures have been investigated intensively. Failure criterions with improved accuracy have been proposed to describe the strength failure characteristics of the RACs. The results indicate that biaxial compressive strength and peak strain after high temperature show an increase compared with that under normal temperature, and the biaxial compressive strength and peak strain have opposite trend with the variation of replacement rate and temperature. The study can provide a scientific instruction for the design of RACs exposed to high temperature.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study assesses the environmental impact of four alternatives for reinforcing 100 m2 of concrete footpath (Functional Unit, FU) by using cradle to gate life cycle assessment (LCA), based on the Australian context. Specifically, the four options considered are a) producing steel reinforcing mesh (SRM), b) producing virgin polypropylene (PP) fibre, c) recycling industrial PP waste and d) recycling domestic PP waste. The FU yields 364 kg of SRM (in a) and 40 kg of PP fibres (in b, c and d), necessary to achieve the same degree of reinforcing in concrete. All the activities required to produce these materials are considered in the study, namely manufacturing and transportation, and also recycling and reprocessing in the case of industrial and domestic recycled PP waste fibres. These processes are individually analysed and quantified in terms of material consumption, water use, and emissions into the environment. This allows for the impacts from producing recycled fibres to be compared with those from producing virgin PP fibre and SRM, which are traditionally used. The LCA results show that industrial recycled PP ﬁbre offers important environmental beneﬁts over virgin PP ﬁbre. Specifically, the industrial recycled PP ﬁbre can save 50% of CO2 equivalent, 65% of PO4 equivalent, 29% of water and 78% of oil equivalent, compared to the virgin PP fibre. When compared to the SRM, the industrial recycled PP fibre can save 93% of CO2 equivalent, 97% of PO4 equivalent, 99% of water and 91% of oil equivalent. The domestic recycled PP fibre also generates reduced environmental impacts compared to virgin PP fibre, except for higher consumption of water associated with the washing processes.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Organic solid and liquid wastes contain large amounts of energy, nutrients, and water, and should not be perceived as merely waste. Recycling, composting, and combustion of non-recyclables have been practiced for decades to capture the energy and values from municipal solid wastes. Treatment and disposal have been the primary management strategy for wastewater. As new technologies are emerging, alternative options for the utilization of both solid wastes and wastewater have become available. Considering the complexity of the chemical, physical, and biological properties of these wastes, multiple technologies may be required to maximize the energy and value recovery from the wastes. For this purpose, biorefining tends to be an appropriate approach to completely utilize the energy and value available in wastes. Research has demonstrated that non-recyclable waste materials and bio-solids can be converted into usable heat, electricity, fuel, and chemicals through a variety of processes, and the liquid waste streams have the potential to support crop and algae growth and provide other energy recovery and food production options. In this paper, we propose new biorefining schemes aimed at organic solid and liquid wastes from municipal sources, food and biological processing plants, and animal production facilities. Four new breakthrough technologies—namely, vacuum-assisted thermophilic anaerobic digestion, extended aquaponics, oily wastes to biodiesel via glycerolysis, and microwave-assisted thermochemical conversion—can be incorporated into the biorefining schemes, thereby enabling the complete utilization of those wastes for the production of chemicals, fertilizer, energy (biogas, syngas, biodiesel, and bio-oil), foods, and feeds, and resulting in clean water and a significant reduction in pollutant emissions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this study, the solid waste plastic was converted into activated carbon fibres through carbonization and chemical activation process. The morphological structure, composition, thermal stability and pore structure of the produced activated carbon materials were characterized. The results revealed that the activation process substantially increases the specific surface area of carbon materials via forming large micropores and mesopores (0.01–0.85 cm3g-1) within average nano size range of 50–100 nm. This study provides an effective means to remove the thymol blue dye via adsorption over activated carbon (ACs) as adsorbent. Batch adsorption of thymol blue was conducted to verify the effect of variety of pH, dye concentrations, contact time, adsorbent dose and temperature. The highest dye removal efficiency (approximately 98.05%) of ACs generated from waste plastic polybags, cups and bottles was observed at 10 ppm of thymol blue dye. The results also exhibited that the dye adsorption was favourable at basic pH (9.0) and increasing amount of adsorbent dosage promotes the dye removal efficiency. The excellent dye removal performance was primarily due to the presence of higher available surface area on the surface of developed carbon fibres. In addition, the current results have given the large overview and useful information of dye removal properties by adsorption isotherm and kinetic measurements. The adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic prospective of formed ACs explored the physical, spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process. The as prepared ACs provided easy regeneration of adsorbents with fast response which further suggests the efficiency of nanoparticles to promote their usage up to 5 consecutive cycles. The current work illustrated that better means to transform solid waste plastic into carbon fibres for providing effective and cheap viable option for the fast removal of thymol blue dye from waste water samples.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The increased quantity of construction and demolition waste and the high carbon footprint of cement production is creating significant environmental problems. This study explored the use of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) in geopolymer concrete (GPC) and reinforced with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars and spirals to fabricate novel and structural GRAGC columns. A total of 9 GRAGC columns with 1150 mm in height and 250 mm in diameter were tested to failure under axial compression. The influence of a different number of longitudinal GFRP bars and spiral spacing on the cracking behaviour, ductility, and axial load-carrying capacity (LCC) were investigated. A nonlinear finite element model (FEM) was implemented to predict the axial compressive response of GRAGC columns. The experimental results depicted that an improvement in the ductility and lateral confinement was observed by decreasing the spacing of GFRP spirals. GRAGC columns with eight longitudinal GFRP bars portrayed the highest LCC. All tested GRAGC columns portrayed similar failure modes with the damage at the central region of the specimens. The theoretical model suggested over a database of 225 GFRP reinforced columns showed a high accuracy compared with the previous models. The present study suggests an efficient and environmental-friendly compression member.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The application of photovoltaics has been rapidly increasing over the past two decades driven by the idea that it could provide a fundamental contribution to the transition from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy based economies. However, long-term sustainability of photovoltaics will be largely dependent on the effectiveness of the process solutions that will be adopted to recycle the unprecedented volume of end-of-life panels expected to be generated in the near future. Recycling is indispensible to avoid the loss of the valuable materials employed to produce the photovoltaic panels and, at the same time, prevent that harmful elements, including, for example, heavy metals, could be dispersed into the environment through improper disposal practices. In this article, the process solutions proposed over the past two decades to recycle photovoltaic panels are critically reviewed. Main objective is to provide the basis for the identification of the recycling solutions that can effectively sustain the continuous increase of the photovoltaic market. In order to assess the requirements that should be satisfied by the recycling processes, the legislation currently in force to regulate the management of end-of-life photovoltaic panels is reviewed, and the evolution of the PV market over the past two decades is analysed. Based on this analysis, forecasts are derived for the flux of end-of-life panels that will be generated over the coming four decades. A technical survey of the previously proposed recycling processes is successively performed by including, in addition to the analysis of the research studies published in scientific articles, a detailed review of the patented recycling processes. Indications are given to which may be the most promising processes in terms of their economic sustainability and environmental impact.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyethylene fibers (PEF) are useful for manufacturing high tenacity concrete with strain hardening and multi-cracking behavior. However, there are few quantitative studies on the complex cracking characteristics of PEF reinforced cement-based materials. In this paper, the external crack fractal dimension (CFD) of PEF-reinforced alkali activated mortar (PEFRAAM) after flexural failure was studied. The cracks on the PEFRAAM could be accurately extracted by the deep learning network. The crack segmentation results were post-processed to obtain the CFD. Experimental results indicated that the CFD of PEFRAAM was increased with the growth of the volume fraction of PEF. The PEF length was more useful than water-binder ratio (WBR) of mortar to mitigate the CFD value increase. Consequently, the maximum CFD was reached in the alkali activated mortar with a WBR of 0.48 and a PEF length of 12 mm. The CFD of PEFRAAM was improved with the growth of PEF reinforcing index in a quadratic function. The critical reinforcing index and density reinforcing index were 150 and 400, respectively. Moreover, the CFD of PEFRAAMs had an obvious positive relation with the flexural strength and the toughness in an exponential function. The excellent correlation between CFD and the flexural toughness before peak load was discovered, resulting from the good correlation between the pre-peak deflection hardening behavior and multi-crack cracking behavior. The full flexural toughness and flexural toughness before peak load could be divided into three regions, whose division thresholds were approximately 1.0 and 1.2. The variation trend of CFD on the flank could reflect the overall cracking pattern of beam, reducing the difficulty to obtain bottom crack information in experiment and engineering.',\n",

Four different waste polymer fibers were investigated as filter bed material for the novel coalescer: polyurethane (PU), polyethylene terephthalate of different origin (PET1 and PET2) and polypropylene (PP). Metal working fluid (MWF) mist from 6% of MWF emulsion was applied as liquid aerosol. Different bed thickness with and without preloading methods were tested to find an optimal separation efficiency for acceptable pressure drop. The applied air velocity through the coalescer was varied from 1\\u202fm/s to 5\\u202fm/s. Experimental results show that all investigated polymer materials could be successfully used as filter bed in the newly developed coalescer. The total separation efficiency is over 96% (between 96.73 and 99.98%) for almost all investigated conditions, except at the air velocity of 1\\u202fm/s, for PU and PP filter bed when it is 88.55% and 91.14%, respectively. Maximal separation efficiency for fraction 1 (0.2–0.3\\u202fµm) and 2 (0.3–1\\u202fµm) is 81.36% and 99.71%, respectively. The coalescer realizes maximal pressure drop of 4.75\\u202fkPa at 5\\u202fm/s air velocity in wet-steady state. The findings indicate that the novel coalescer could be easily optimized depending on inlet air quality and permissible level of PM1 in the outlet air.',\n",

The materials were presumed to be oxo-biodegradable plastics with thicknesses varying between 30 and 70\\u202fμm, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) filler content reaching up to 11\\u202fwt%. Accelerated (aging) weathering tests conducted revealed that UV radiation triggered the biodegradation mechanism. Weight loss reached 50% after exposure to weathering which was attributed to triggering the fragmentation of the plastic films. Furthermore, some 83% of weight loss was estimated after 12 months of soil burial. Fluctuation of weight in mid exposure time spans was related to the cross-linking reaction within the polymeric matrix. The mechanical properties investigated along with the thermal stability profile determined for the materials showed that weathering was more severe than soil burial. Thermogravimetry revealed that onset temperature (Tos) was lower than conventional PO products by 25\\u202f°C. This could be attributed to the thermal response of the materials due to presence of ion salts and sterates within their composition. The claims by the manufacturing companies which provided the original specimens under an environmentally friendly pretence is disputed due to the fact that none of the products actually showed evidence of major fragmentation or deterioration after exposure to harsh environments. The work also paves the way in standardising assessment methodology for examining biodegradable plastics.',\n",

In this study, we present a novel route for the upcycling of waste plastics, wherein synthetic graphite is prepared from a waste polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) bottle through a facile and scalable method. PET was successfully converted to graphite via a synthetic method of pyrolysis at 900 °C followed by boron-assisted catalytic graphitization at 2400 °C. This technique overcame the intrinsic non-graphitizable property of PET and yielded graphite showing high crystallinity with the maximum crystallite size of 20.9 nm in Lc and the d(002) spacing of 3.373 Å. In particular, it showed a much higher degree of graphitization (80.6%) than that (68.9%) derived from a well-known AR mesophase pitch (Mitsubishi). In addition, via a microwave-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation, the PET-derived graphite was successfully exfoliated as graphene sheets with the average lateral size of 410 nm. We expect that our work can guide the innovative upcycling of waste plastics to invaluable synthetic graphite, which has many potential applications such as anode materials in secondary batteries and fillers for carbon composites, and may serve as an alternative source for graphene production.',\n",

The reduction of natural resource exploration and recovery of waste are examples of actions to contribute to a sustainable development. Waste from end-of-life tires and undifferentiated plastics represents an environmental problem due to the very high number of tons of used tires and plastics produced, but with a high economic potential because their incorporation into high value-added products is an issue of utmost importance. The manufacturing technologies oriented to the increase in quality levels, functional advantages, structural and financial gains of the produced products are currently a hot topic in industry. Similarly, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, instead of conventional techniques, e.g. moulding to process materials obtained from waste recovery, is a great industrial challenge. In order to promote greater environmental responsibility and to present innovative solutions for the management and sustainable destination of used waste recovery from tires and undifferentiated plastics, a composite made from the blend of 60% of tire waste granulate and 40% of polypropylene (PP) recycled was tested with the final purpose of generating components with added value. Both waste recovery materials were used in the micronized state. The thermal and mechanical behaviours of the synthesized composite were studied through DSC/TGA analysis and tensile testing. The implementation of additive manufacturing methodologies to process the blends between used tires granulated with a high incorporation of wastes from undifferentiated plastics was also explored in this work in order to produce big green parts without mould needed, such as urban furniture.',\n",

As the value of resources contained within waste has become more recognized, and technology has enabled the recovery of such value, collection schemes have evolved. The mode and frequency of collection are typically driven by legislative, economic or environmental reasons. For example, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 stated that a waste collection authority in England must arrange for the collection of at least two recyclable materials, either mixed or separated. Therefore, source-segregation was made compulsory in England following this Act.

       " {'context': 'Polyurethanes (PUs) are an important and versatile class of polymers that are applied in industry, building construction and in various consumer products. However, the rigid and complex structure of PU makes it challenging to deal with PU at end-of-life, while without appropriate waste treatment, disposed PU products may result in severe environmental pollution. Thermochemical recycling processes allow the production of valuable chemicals from PU waste streams and may enable circular recycling routes. This review focuses on pyrolysis of PUs studied by thermogravimetric methods as well as on experiments conducted in micro or bench-scale lab reactors, that allow to study the product distribution and the thermal decomposition chemistry relevant for pyrolysis and gasification processes. PUs typically decompose in multiple stages as function of the temperature, whereby generally the isocyanate linkers disassociate at lower temperatures and the high molecular weight polyol linkers decompose at higher temperatures. The product distributions were found to strongly depend on the composition of PU and the pyrolysis conditions, while the presence of fire retardants and other additives did hardly have an effect. By further development and optimization, it is expected that pyrolysis and gasification can be suitable alternatives to deal with growing amounts of PU waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recently the Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHFRC) presents remarkable advantages compared to the other types of concrete. Compared to the ordinary concrete, higher packing density was achieved using refine aggregates which resulted in increasing density by the percentage of 15% and consequently compressive strength of 160%. Additionally, higher durability focusing lower water absorption factor of 1 and chloride ion diffusion of 1 mm were reported. The main drawback is related to the initial cost of this material which are mainly related to the higher prices of cement and steel fibre which limited to use it frequently. Based on this fact the paper is prepared by introducing potentialities of using some recycled materials which can be utilized for producing some eco-efficient and affordable UHPFRC. Emphasis is given for employing Recycled Steel Fibre (RSF) from end-life tires for reinforcing cementitious matrix concrete and spent Equilibrium catalyst (Ecat) from the oil refinery company to be partially replaced by sand and/or cement in concrete mixtures. Detrimental effects of RSF by 4% decreasing the compressive strength was reported in the literature for producing HPC due to adverse effects of rubbers and synthetic particles attached to the RSF. Consequently, maximum volume of these particles was suggested no to be more than 5%. Tensile properties improvement of HPC was reported using RSF by increasing ductility and postcracking behaviour with higher than 1% volume of friction RSF. Regarding to the effects of RSF on the early age concrete, 67% of shrinkage was reported to be occurred at the end of 4 days casting. Higher affinity for water absorption of Ecat was fund to be important factor in decreasing workability of fresh mortars which affects the initial and final setting time. Compressive strength improvement about 45% was reported when 15%–20% of cement was replaced by Ecat.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Up to 25% of plastic waste in Europe is still disposed of in landfills, despite recycling efforts. The plastic waste in the landfill plot may be exposed both to abiotic and biotic degradation processes, although it is thought that most of the plastic materials tend to be resistant to biodegradation or biodeterioration even after a long time. To verify if polypropylene (PP) can undergo the process of short-term biodegradation and how this process is manifested in a municipal waste landfill, we collected a plastic sample from an already closed landfill plot estimating its age at approximately 5 years. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy led to sample identification as PP as well as showed additional bands which are not specific to polymer structure but rather result from microbial metabolism. Differential Scanning Calorimetry was performed to examine the influence of the environmental degradation process on the degree of crystallisation of the tested PP. Moreover, significant changes on the surface of an old PP packaging were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showing clear signs of PP delamination which resulted in microplastic particles formation (smaller than 5 μm in diameter). Additionally, several round and oval shaped structures were observed with SEM leading to the suspicion of biofilm formation on the PP surface. Indeed, the microorganisms were present in a vast amount on the old PP surface and possibly formed a viable biofilm as it was confirmed with fluorescence microscopy. These data show that plastic waste can be inhabited by microorganisms from the ambient environment which may probably lead to its faster degradation. However, this process should be investigated in more detail in order to shed light upon the possible risk factors of plastic biodegradation in waste landfills to the environment and human health. Even after five years, polypropylene can undergo deterioration/biodegradation in a waste landfill with viable microbial cells on its surface, possibly involved in its degradation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Concrete production contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, thus a need exists for the development of durable and sustainable concrete with a lower carbon footprint. This can be achieved when cement is partially replaced with another material, such as waste plastic, though normally with a tradeoff in compressive strength. This study discusses progress toward a high/medium strength concrete with a dense, cementitious matrix that contains an irradiated plastic additive, recovering the compressive strength while displacing concrete with waste materials to reduce greenhouse gas generation. Compressive strength tests showed that the addition of high dose (100kGy) irradiated plastic in multiple concretes resulted in increased compressive strength as compared to samples containing regular, non-irradiated plastic. This suggests that irradiating plastic at a high dose is a viable potential solution for regaining some of the strength that is lost when plastic is added to cement paste. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Backscattered Electron Microscopy (BSE), and X-ray microtomography explain the mechanisms for strength retention when using irradiated plastic as a filler for cement paste. By partially replacing Portland cement with a recycled waste plastic, this design may have a potential to contribute to reduced carbon emissions when scaled to the level of mass concrete production.',\n",

The structural evolution of catalyst on overall scope, including the topology of heterogeneous pore systems and spatial distribution of zeolite was probed by X-ray nano-CT. The results showed that FCC enhanced the transformation of C16-C30 chains to C9-centered monocyclic aromatics. The nano-CT analysis of FCCs illustrated remarkable loss of exterior porosity after reaction, particularly at the depth of ∼16.5 μ m from the outmost layer.

Bioplastics degradation under different environments has been described and reported to depend mainly on bioplastics’ compositions and the environmental conditions. Incomplete degradation during waste management processes and leakage of bioplastics into the environment are becoming major concerns that need to be further investigated. In this context, the present paper aimed to review recent literature dealing with biodegradation of bioplastics under industrial (e.g. anaerobic digestion and composting) and natural (e.g. soil and water) environments, and to link it to the potential bioplastics’ leakage into the environment. Reviewed data were used to estimate the potential role of waste management processes in decreasing the potential leakage of bioplastics. Depending on bioplastics’ type and processing conditions, waste management can effectively reduce bioplastics’ potential leakage, decreasing the concentration of these materials that can reach the natural environments.',\n",

By contrast, only a few examples of fuel-gas production plants have been reported. This study investigates the feasibility of fuel-gas production from plastic waste using a bench-scale pyrolysis plant by analyzing the material and energy balances of the plant. As part of a waste-to-fuel-gas project for substituting natural gas used in cogeneration equipment, this study examines the material and energy balances during operation of an externally heated rotary kiln reactor. The scale-up simulation of a 200-kg/h plant was performed based on the operation results obtained for a 2-kg/h plant using polypropylene and laminates of polypropylene with polyethylene terephthalate as feedstock. Based on the 200-kg/h plant estimates, the amount of fuel generated as fuel gas, fuel-gas consumed, and excess fuel gas used for supplying electricity to a factory using a cogeneration system equaled 3.86 × 107, 1.49 × 107, and 2.42 × 107 MJ/year, respectively, in terms of the lower heating value. The excess fuel could be used as a natural-gas substitute in cogeneration systems. In cases where a fuel-gas production system with 200-kg/h capacity costs less than USD 2,467,000, the pyrolysis-based fuel production is considered economically beneficial compared to the current treatment methods owing to the associated cost savings of up to approximately USD 177,000/year realized by ensuring substitution of 2.42 × 107 MJ/year of natural gas.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study aims at investigating the influence of polyethylene wax (PW) additives on the performance of modified asphalt binders and mixtures. Three types of PW additives, including low density wax (LDPW), high density wax (HDPW), and oxidized polyethylene wax (OPW) were selected with different molecular weight (Mw). Fischer-Tropsch wax (FTW) and Montan wax (MW) additives were also selected for comparison. Then, several laboratory tests were conducted, including performance grade test, storage ability test, viscosity test, workability test, wheel tracking test, Hamburg wheel tracking device test (HWTD), tensile strength ratio (TSR) test, bending beam test and semi-circular bending (SCB) test. Besides, the fluorescence microscopy test was conducted to investigate the modifying mechanism of different wax additives. Results indicate that, almost all tested wax additives improve the high temperature stability and moisture resistance capacity of the asphalt mixture, while reduce the low temperature stability. As the Mw increases, the rational viscosity of the asphalt binder, the moisture resistance capacity and low temperature stability of PW modified asphalt mixture increases, while the storage stability decreases. PW additives perform better in low temperature cracking resistance capacity than AMW and FTW. OPW has the best modifying performance among all selected PW additives due to the uniform microstructure.',\n",

This study aims to propose the use of geocell reinforced (GR) reclaimed construction waste (RCW) composite base, and to solve the problems of low strength and being prone to cracking of recycled base caused by poor performance of brick. In this paper, cement stabilized RCW mixture (C-RM) and RCW lean concrete (R-LC) are selected. Through laboratory tests and large-scale plate load test, the mechanical property of single GR RCW specimen and bearing capacity of GR RCW composite base are evaluated. Furthermore, based on the experiments, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used for the mechanical analysis of GR reclaimed base asphalt pavement (RBAP). Results indicate that geocell has obvious reinforcement effect on the RCW concrete, and the effect is closely related to the brick/concrete ratio and specimen diameter. The displacement of RCW composite base is reduced, the resilient modulus is improved and the stress diffusion effect is enhanced obviously. What’s more, the bearing capability of GR R-CL is higher than that of GR C-RM. Additionally, geocell can improve the mechanical response of RBAP, and the main influence range is within 0.5 m from wheel load center.',\n",

Existing reviews on pyrolysis mainly focus on agroforestry biomass and conventional pyrolysis heating techniques. There is limited literature on the application of recent pyrolysis techniques, types of reactors, key operating parameters, and properties of pyrolysis products from conventional versus recent/novel pyrolysis techniques, and particularly the application of the oil products in fuel engines. Here we focus on the performance of various pyrolysis techniques for valorizing municipal wastes, with an explicit emphasis on the progress and application of co-pyrolysis as a recent technique for value-added products recovery from municipal wastes. We review the main operating parameters of co-pyrolysis, concerns and disputes arisen from the technique, and the resultant liquid fuel properties. In particular, co-pyrolysis using microwave heating shows proficiency to resolve several drawbacks of conventional pyrolysis techniques such as reduced oxygen content and viscosity and increased calorific value of liquid oil, hence promising as a method to generate environmental friendly and sustainable third-generation fuels. Sorting of municipal wastes is recommended as an approach to improve the feasibility of co-pyrolysis by having desired quantity and type of municipal wastes as the feedstock, and more research and development on co-pyrolysis utilizing municipal wastes is necessary to maximize the yield and quality of target pyrolytic products. Thus, we conclude that co-pyrolysis is a feasible and sustainable method for recovering biofuel from municipal wastes to obtain green energy and energy security.',\n",

Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are present in such fractions as a mixture. For instance, the ratio of PP and PE in car scrap is 70:30 on average. However, the grade of the PP and PE should typically be better than 97% to be reused again as a high quality product. Density separation of the different polyolefins can be a solution. A promising separation technique is the inverse magnetic density separator (IMDS). This paper discusses the potential of shredder residue, one of the possible polyolefin’s waste stream sources for the IMDS, in detail. Experiments with the separation of polyolefins with an IMDS prototype show both high grade and high recovery.

Recycled materials are becoming an interesting alternative, due to their good acoustic behavior, similar to traditional porous materials; they also allow low impact production costs, thanks to the use of wastes derived from other production cycles. This work focuses on the evaluation of the acoustic absorption properties of new panels made of recycled paper and other scrap materials, as wool and nonwoven polyester fabric: different samples were produced and tested by means of impedance tube, according to ISO 10534-2. In order to present the environmental benefits, Life Cycle Assessment was carried out in terms of primary embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions, considering a “cradle-to-gate” approach. Furthermore, the behavior of innovative absorption materials was investigated in order to improve the acoustic performance of a lecture room, by means of an acoustic simulation software. A comparison with traditional materials was also carried out for both acoustic and environmental aspects. In the simulation model, calibrated by an in-situ experimental campaign of the main acoustic quality indexes (Reverberation Time, Clarity and Definition Indexes, Speech Transmission Index), different acoustic correction solutions were implemented: both the new recycled and traditional panels were applied as wall and ceiling absorbers. The analysis of the acoustic absorption trends, in 100 - 5000Hz frequencies range, shows that the new materials are suitable as acoustic correction systems, especially the panel composed by waste paper and wool fibers. The LCA analysis results show that, considering the same acoustic performance, the recycled panels allow to reduce the environmental effects and the global production costs.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this work, catalytic fast pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE) into highly valuable naphtha by the relay catalysis (Al2O3 followed by ZSM-5 zeolite) was conducted. Effects of different catalysts, pyrolysis temperatures, catalyst to plastic ratio, and Al2O3 to ZSM-5 ratio, on product distribution and selectivity were studied. Al2O3 shows an excellent performance for catalytic reforming of LDPE pyrolysis vapors, mainly producing C5-C23 olefins that are the important precursors to form aromatics via Diels-Alder, aromatization, and polymerization reactions in the pores of ZSM-5 catalyst. Experimental results also show that the selectivity of monoaromatics and C5-C12 alkanes/olefins can be up to 100% over Al2O3 followed by ZSM-5 relay catalysis at the temperature of 550 °C, the catalyst to plastic ratio of 4:1, and Al2O3 to ZSM-5 ratio of 1:1. The product (monoaromatics and C5-C12 alkanes/olefins), naphtha, could be a renewable feedstock for new plastic production in the petroleum industry so that this finding might provide a new insight for a circular economy.',\n",

Complementary characterization methods, such as BET, ICP, TEM, XRD, FTIR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, TGA, and CHNS, were conducted to relate surface functionality and structure to the activity of catalysts. The catalytic activity and stability with ten days on stream at 700 °C were investigated. It was found that the catalyst properties such as surface area and the number of acid sites play a crucial role in catalyst activity. The feed conversion and hydrogen yield for the optimum catalyst that is Ni–Pt/Ti–Al were found to be 92% and 75%, respectively.

       " {'context': 'The commonly used pyrolytic catalysts (molecular sieves, metals, etc.) are expensive and easily inactivated, which is a major difficulty in the catalytic pyrolysis technology. In this work, the effect of low-cost kaolin with different particle sizes on the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in fixed furnace and its reusability are studied. The results show that the liquid oil mainly contains aliphatics and aromatics. The carbon number of liquid oils is mainly in the range of C6-C20, accounting for 90%-95%. The first addition of 1250 mesh kaolin (K1250) produces the highest contents of aliphatics (64.66%) and hydrocarbons (93.91%) and H2 (30.07%). During the repeated use of K1250, the increasing trend of aromatics content was consistent with the results of particle size increase. The presence of carbon deposition after the use of the catalyst causes slight coking, which increases the acidity and particle size of the catalyst. K1250 is suitable for the production of liquid oil with better quality (more hydrocarbons, more aliphatic groups) and higher yield in the early stage of use. However, it is suitable to produce pyrolysis gas with high quality (more hydrogen and methane) and high yield in the later stage of reuse.',\n",

However, chemicals present in recycled plastics is one of the key qualities affecting their potential uses and deserves more attention. 475 migrants coming from 15 postconsumer recycled polyolefins were identified by direct immersion-solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (DI-SPME-GC-MS) and atmospheric pressure-gas chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (APGC-QTOF-MS). About 60 % of them might not be of human risk because they were food additives/components or they are saturated hydrocarbons, fatty acyls, or prenol lipids. Most of them had molecular weight (MW) between 150 and 210 Da, though, high concern substances with high MW (e.g. octocrylene) implied that high MW surrogates are required to study the efficiency of recycling processes for polyolefins. The mean predicted octanol/water partition coefficient (XLogP) was about 6.5 and 3.5 for 95 % ethanol and 3 % acetic acid food simulants, respectively. Octocrylene, 1-tetradecene, 1-dodecene, dodecyl acrylate, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diethyl ester, benzenamine, 2,4-dichloro-, and diethyl phthalate were of high concern depending on the potential food contact use of the materials.

       " {'context': \"Although the toxicity of microplastics has already been demonstrated in different animal models, our knowledge about the response of freshwater fish to this pollutant is still limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impact of exposure of zebrafish adults (Danio rerio) to environmentally relevant concentrations of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) (5 and 50 µg/L) and at different times of exposure (10 and 20 days). Initially, scanning electron microscope image illustrated size and format of the particle and FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of PE-MPs in the gastrointestinal tract of fish (at both concentrations tested). Subsequently, an alteration of oxidative and antioxidant responses was evaluated in the liver and brain. The results showed that catalase (CAT) activity, in liver, was significantly decreased, as was glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity (on the 10th experimental day). However, after 20 days of exposure, we observed a concentration-dependent increase in GST activity in liver of the animals exposed to PE-MPs. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation (LPO) level was significantly increased by exposure to MPs, especially in the brain, after 20 days of exposure. The increase in Na+-K+-ATPase activity in the animals' gills was correlated with the increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA), which suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanism in which the high activity of this enzyme would be necessary to regulate the loss of ions caused by the increase in the processes of LPO, which has never been previously demonstrated. Thus, our study sheds light on a new physiological adaptation to deal with the oxidative effects of PE-MPs, in addition to supporting the future use of the assessment of Na+/K+-ATPase activity as a biomarker of the toxicity of these pollutants.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Sugarcane is a cash crop that has been a significant source of revenue in many countries around the world. In the last few decades, sugarcane mills that were only intended for sugar production were converted into biorefineries. Biorefinery enables the co-production of useful products from the sugarcane wastes such as bagasse, molasses, cane trash, filter mud and vinasse. In certain applications like disposable plates, fly ash, and as reinforcement in polymer composites, bagasse can be directly employed without the need for secondary processing while applications like paper, biochemical, lignosulfonate, vanillin, etc., require secondary processing through the biochemical route involving pre-treatment, acid hydrolysis, and fermentation. Other sugarcane wastes can also be mixed with bagasse to obtain biomethane, bioethanol, and bioelectricity. This article focuses on the recent advancements in such pre-treatment and processing methods employed by the researchers. It also outlines the strategies to co-generate two different products and ways to maximize the product yield and highlights various parameters influencing the process. The challenges that are critical to the sustainability of the sugarcane biorefineries and their mitigations were also discussed.',\n",

       " {'context': \"With over half of the world's population living in cities, and with rising consumption, the generation of solid waste has become a ubiquitous and serious problem in urban agglomerations. City administrations are facing social, cultural, environmental, and economic challenges when planning solid waste solutions. The paper discusses the participatory epistemology and methodology experience resulting from inclusive solid waste management in Brazil. In the global South countless informal and organized solid waste collectors are engaged in resource recovery, classification of discarded waste, and redirection of recyclables towards the recycling sector. Their work is mostly unrecognized and the service is not remunerated. Governmental support to include recycling cooperatives in selective waste collection varies significantly in scope and quality. In theory, the Brazilian solid waste management legislation supports recycling cooperatives and promotes avoidance, reuse, and recycling as a primary solution tackling waste. In praxis, however, many challenges towards inclusive resource recovery and awareness building about waste avoidance and diversion are yet to be overcome. Action-oriented, participatory qualitative research, conducted with recycling cooperatives and local governments in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, has revealed some of the environmental and social contributions, as well as challenges arising in planning, policy design, and implementation of waste management. The research applies a feminist and post-colonial theoretical lense and demonstrates a wealth of knowledge co-generation on waste management. The participatory method underlines important social aspects to consider in planning and policy design for inclusive waste management. The final conclusion of this paper is that selective household waste collection with recycling cooperatives creates unique opportunities to build more inclusive and cleaner cities.\",\n",

The higher demand and production practices have increased the burden of plastic waste which can be efficiently reused by different recycling methods. The mechanical and chemical recycling of polymer products is commercially implemented but thermal recycling is comparatively less popular due to limited research in material properties and economic aspects. This article aims to highlight the material properties through tensile and FTIR testing of repeatedly recycled thermoplastic polymers along with detailed literature survey. The thermoplastic polymer samples are heated under controlled environment using screw extrusion process followed by cooling to manufacture a filament. The filament is subjected to tensile loading for analysis of mechanical strength which indicates that three repeated heating and cooling cycles retained the mechanical strength and findings were supported by FTIR results.

       " {'context': 'Plastic growing demand and the increment in global plastics production have raised the number of spent plastics, out of which over 90% are either landfilled or incinerated. Both methods for handling spent plastics are susceptible to releasing toxic substances, damaging air, water, soil, organisms, and public health. Improvements to the existing infrastructure for plastics management are needed to limit chemical additive release and exposure resulting from the end-of-life (EoL) stage. This article analyzes the current plastic waste management infrastructure and identifies chemical additive releases through a material flow analysis. Additionally, we performed a facility-level generic scenario analysis of the current U.S. EoL stage of plastic additives to track and estimate their potential migration, releases, and occupational exposure. Potential scenarios were analyzed through sensitivity analysis to examine the merit of increasing recycling rates, using chemical recycling, and implementing additive extraction post-recycling. Our analyses identified that the current state of plastic EoL management possesses high mass flow intensity toward incineration and landfilling. Although maximizing the plastic recycling rate is a reasonably straightforward goal for enhancing material circularity, the conventional mechanical recycling method requires improvement because major chemical additive release and contamination routes act as obstacles to achieving high-quality plastics for future reuse and should be mitigated through chemical recycling and additive extraction. The potential hazards and risks identified in this research create an opportunity to design a safer closed-loop plastic recycling infrastructure to handle additives strategically and support sustainable materials management efforts to transform the US plastic economy from linear to circular.',\n",

Currently, eco-friendly and cost-effective biodegradable films are considered the most promising substitutes for nondegradable plastic mulching films. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and eco-friendly strategy to utilize the gelatin extracted from scrap skin in leather processing and prepare novel biodegradable mulch films. The gelatin chains were covalently cross-linked with tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride to reduce the hygroscopicity of gelatin. Then, polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) was introduced into the gelatin network. The hydrogen bonds between the gelatin and PVOH and several PVOH crystalline domains acted as sacrificial bonds for energy dissipation. Thus, the multi-cross-linked gelatin matrix (GP) films showed high fracture stress (12.03–31.99 MPa) and fracture strain (211.99%–379.73%). Such high mechanical performance is comparable to that of traditional low-density polyethylene mulch films and conforms to the GB/T 35,795 regulatory standards. In addition to their excellent mechanical properties, the mulch films exhibited good water resistance, excellent light transmittance, and good biodegradability in soil. All properties of the GP films are tunable, and their eco-friendliness, low cost, and excellent properties endow them with great application potential as eco-friendly mulch films for agriculture.',\n",

The impurities in the waste were collected, and their existence states were characterized as independent metal nickel and diamond. The nickel impurity was removed from the waste by ultrasound-assisted leaching using a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and the optimal leaching efficiency reached 99.67% under the conditions of sulfuric acid: nitric acid\\u202f=\\u202f2:1 (v/v), 4\\u202fmol/L H+ concentration, 4\\u202fmL/g liquid-solid ratio, 45\\u202f°C, 30\\u202fmin, 200\\u202frpm, 240\\u202fW ultrasonic power and 45\\u202fkHz ultrasonic frequency. Subsequently, nickel ions in the lixivium were recycled in the form of nickel sulfate through extraction and stripping treatments. The diamond impurity was removed by bulk heating in flowing oxygen, and the optimal removal ratio was 99.65% under the conditions of 800\\u202f°C, 30\\u202fmin and oxygen flow of 400\\u202fmL/min. High-purity α-Al2O3 was successfully recovered from the sapphire kerf waste after the grinding process, which had a purity higher than 99.99\\u202fwt% and an average diameter of 0.6\\u202fμm. In addition, the kinetics of leaching nickel and diamond removal were systematically analysed based on the shrinking model, and the chemical reaction was found to be the control step. The reaction mechanisms of the two processes were also studied. The economic evaluation revealed that the profit from dealing with 1\\u202fkg sapphire kerf waste with this method was $13.68.

       " {'context': 'To achieving highly efficient reuse of commingled waste plastic films (CWPF) in high-density polyethylene (HDPE), elastomer-olefin block copolymer (OBC) was adopted to improve the compatibility between CWPF and HDPE, and solid-state drawing was further used to improve the mechanical properties of the blends. The results showed that OBC could form core-shell structure with CWPF, as a bridge layer to simultaneously connect CWPF and HDPE, and form epitaxial crystallization induced by HDPE crystals, thereby greatly enhancing the compatibility between CWPF and HDPE, and improving the tensile strength, elongation at break and impact strength of HDPE/CWPF blend. In the subsequent solid-state drawing, depending on the fluidity of OBC at the drawing temperature of 100 °C, more CWPF were covered, efficiently reducing the defects caused by CWPF along the transverse direction (TD) and increasing the elongation at break of the stretched sheet along this direction. With the increase of draw ratio, lamellae in fibril along TD and shish-kebab-like structure along the flow direction (FD) formed, greatly improving the tensile strength of the blend along both TD and FD. And the long period (Lp), amorphous region (La) and lateral dimension (Llateral) decreased, but lamella thickness (Lc) increased. This work provides good bases for obtaining novel and low-cost HDPE based material as well as high-effect recycling of CWPF.',\n",

In 2010, 61% of the MSW generated in the European Union (EU) ended up in landfill and incineration facilities. Autoclaving is a novel technology that can be used to treat unsorted MSW, producing organic fibers that can be composted. The life cycle analysis (LCA) was used to assess the effectiveness of autoclaving unsorted MSW and various alternative methods for treating organic fibers produced through this process. The alternative methods that were considered included composting in tunnels, composting in confined windrow and composting in turning windrow as well as anaerobic digestion. The environmental assessment results were compared to those associated with incineration and landfill. The results of this study showed that autoclaving with sorting, digesting anaerobically and composting had the lowest impact values for eutrophication and the global warming potential. It was also found that autoclaving is justified only if the products of the process, that is, polyethylene terephthalate, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, are recycled to avoid virgin material production and if the remaining mixed plastic wastes are incinerated for energy recovery.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The production of large quantities of industrial waste salts is becoming an issue of increasing concern with the adoption of the “zero liquid discharge” process for wastewater treatment. Recovery of waste salts as a useful resource after purification provides the best means of solving this problem. In this study, pyrolysis was studied as a purification technique to treat waste salt generated during hydrazine hydrate production (N2H4 WS) within the temperature range of 25–600 °C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Aerobic pyrolysis achieved 99.3% organic removal at a temperature that was 50 °C lower than was that achieved by anaerobic pyrolysis (600 °C). The formation of strong fluorescent species at 400 °C during anaerobic pyrolysis was detected using fluorescence excitation emission matrix (FEEM). These species were confirmed to be heterocyclic-N compounds, including pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, that were formed through cyclization reactions, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS). Harmful gases such as HCN and NH3 were released during anaerobic pyrolysis, and this may have been partially associated with the decomposition of heterocyclic-N compounds. Moreover, aerobic pyrolysis effectively reduced CO2 emissions by 8.7% based on energy consumption calculations. Therefore, aerobic pyrolysis is preferable for the purification of N2H4 WS owing to its low decomposition temperature, minimal release of harmful gaseous compounds, and low carbon emissions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Microplastic pollution is a ubiquitous and emerging environmental and public health concern in Africa due to increased plastic production, product and waste importation, and usage. While studies on the environmental monitoring and characterization of microplastics demonstrated the urgent need for a drastic reduction in plastic waste generation, the effectiveness of the various regulatory and policy interventions implemented or proposed in Africa countries remains poorly understood. We critically examined policies, legislations, and regulations enacted to control microplastic pollution in Africa to develop a sustainable, harmonized framework for the coordinated reduction of plastic waste generation across Africa. Analysis of the interventions revealed most African countries employed traditional perspective (i.e., command-and-control) approaches, whereby state instruments such as plastic ban, production and importation levies, and consumer taxes were enacted. However, the continued increase in microplastic waste generation suggests traditional perspective approaches might not be effective in Africa. Although rarely used in Africa, market-oriented approaches such as private-public waste management are often effective in controlling plastic pollution. Hence, we proposed a bottom-up hybrid regulatory approach for managing microplastics pollution in Africa, involving price-based, right-base, legislation and behavioral frameworks based on best practices in microplastic waste management.',\n",

The aim is to quantify the environmental consequences of different alternatives in order to evaluate opportunities and limitations to select the best and most feasible plastic waste recovery option to decrease the GHG emissions. The methodologies of material flow analysis (MFA) for a time period of thirteen years and consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) have been integrated. The study focuses on Spain as a representative country for Europe. The results show that to improve resource efficiency and avoid more GHG emissions, the options for plastic waste management are dependent on the quality of the recovered plastic. The results also show that there is an increasing trend of exporting plastic waste for recycling, mainly to China, that reduces the GHG benefits from recycling, suggesting that a new focus should be introduced to take into account the split between local recycling and exporting.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Waste tires (WTs) are one of the most critical environmental problems worldwide. Since the WTs cannot be landfilled or burned, innovative solutions and proper solid waste management are needed. Therefore, several methods have been proposed for WTs treatment. Among these methods, the pyrolysis process is considered the most favorable. Pyrolysis is a process of converting WTs in absence of oxygen into pyrogas, fuel oil, and a by-product, which is pyrolyzed carbon black (PCB). To introduce the idea of eco-friendly and sustainable concrete, it is proposed to use PCB as an additive in concrete structures. In this experimental investigation, PCB samples are obtained from a local pyrolyzed WTs plant. Several concrete properties are investigated considering different mixes of different weight percentage ratios of PCB to cement (PCB/c); 0% (control sample), 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 7%, and 10%. Typically, fixed amounts of cement, water, sand, aggregate, and superplasticizer are prepared following international preparation standards, and then, mixed with the aforementioned PCB/c ratios. Afterward, an array of mechanical tests are performed investigating properties enhancements. These tests are slump, compressive strength, and abrasion resistance, along with water absorption. Results show a noticeable increase in the compressive strength for tested samples of 29.3 and 38.4 MPa were obtained at a ratio of 4% for 7 and 28 days, respectively. This is combined with a slight reduction of slump results; however; slump values are still within standard limits for most of the mixes. In addition, abrasion resistance results suggest a vital improvement in the PCB/c mixes. Also, water absorption measurements reflect enhancement of concrete mixes up to a specific percentage of PCB. Amongst tested PCB/c ratios, the study highlights the optimal value to be between 3% and 5%. In addition, a multi-level framework on the impact of institutional pressures on the adoption of PCB as an additive to cement has been addressed to rationalize and raise awareness towards the applicability of such a feasible approach. Thus, the overall results reflect the promising horizons of using PCB as an improving additive material in concrete mixes.',\n",

The mixed food waste has recorded the more waste reduction efficiency and more larval biomass yield followed by restaurant waste and fruit waste by using the black soldier fly. Termites can be effectively used for the degradation of ligneous solid waste. Waxworm and Meal moth are the insects that make the plastic degrade with the help of the microorganisms present in the insect gut. Microorganisms may include bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, etc. At last, using the insect as a decomposer will be a novel approach to waste management and this can be employed in a commercial manner.            \",\n",

The concept was developed on the basis of existing ELV policies and legislation, processing framework, waste management and recycling possibilities for converting ELVs into building products. The findings corroborate that ELV waste in the dismantling and shredding operations can be utilised by the construction industry. The analysis and proposed framework established a source of information that provides a new paradigm for prioritising building product development and related policies in Malaysia.

The detailed analysis of the derived products from the pyrolysis of plastics provides data on the suitability of the process and the influence of process conditions on the compatibility of the feedstock produced with the conventional petroleum feedstock. Low density polyethylene (LDPE) is a major component of municipal solid waste and this paper describes the influence of pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 700°C on the yield and composition of the derived products. The main gases produced from the pyrolysis of LDPE were hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, butane and butene. There was a dramatic increase in gas yield with increasing temperature of pyrolysis. Analysis of the derived oils and waxes showed that the pyrolysis of LDPE gave a mainly aliphatic composition consisting of a series of alkanes, alkenes and alkadienes which showed a decrease in concentration as the pyrolysis temperature was increased. The oil showed an increase in aromatic composition with increasing temperature of pyrolysis and at 700°C significant concentrations of single ring aromatic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected. The derived oil and wax have great potential to be recycled back into the petrochemicals industry as a feedstock for the production of new plastics or the production of refined fuels.',\n",

Herein, functionalized reduced GO (BHET-rGO) with single-layer was obtained by modifying GO with BHET, and then reduced by hydrazine hydrate. Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) nanocomposites with excellent mechanical performance, electrical and thermal conductivities were prepared via in-situ polymerization using the novel functional crosslinker BHET-rGO. Compared with the same content of rGO (7.41 wt%), WPU/BHET-rGO composites exhibit better properties containing equivalent BHET content. For example, BHET-rGO endows the WPU composites with higher tensile strength of 39.1 MPa (enhanced by 454.6%), electrical conductivity of 8×10−3 S/m (improved by 15 times), and thermal conductivity of 0.551 W m−1 K−1 (increased by 21.1%). Meanwhile, the sensitivity of WPU/BHET-rGO composite is well recovered during a large-strain stretching/shrinking cycle, and its resistance is stable under complex deformation. Besides, significant thermal stability ensures the durable of polyurethane to resist high-temperature. Hence, BHET-rGO have greater potential for fabricating high-performance elastomer composites, especially for conductive elastomer composites.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Since an invention of synthetic fibers (textiles), our life quality has been improved. However, the cumulative production and disposal of them have perceived as significant since they are not biodegradable and hard to be upcycled/recycled. From washing textiles, microplastics are released into the environment, which are regarded as emerging contaminants. As a means for source reduction of microplastics, this study proposed a rapid disposal platform for waste textiles (WTs), converting them into value-added products. To this end, catalytic pyrolysis of WT was studied. To offer more environmentally sound process, CO2 was used as a raw material for WT pyrolysis. Thermal cracking of WT led to the production of syngas and CH4 under the CO2 environment. CO2 resulted in additional CO production via gas phase reaction with volatile compounds evolved from pyrolysis of WT. To expedite the reaction kinetics for syngas formation, catalytic pyrolysis was done over Co-based catalyst. Comparing to non-catalytic pyrolysis, CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis had 3- and 8-times higher production of H2 and CO, respectively. This process also suppressed catalyst deactivation, converting more than 80 wt% of WT into syngas and CH4. The more generation of CO from the use of CO2 as a raw material offers an effective means to minimize the formations of harmful chemical species, such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.',\n",

Concrete slurry waste from the production of prestressed poles in the original (CSW) and Fe-modified (CSWFe) forms was tested as a sorbent of chromate (CrO4 2-) from contaminated waters. The CSW and CSWFe were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Specific surface area (SBET), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). As a result of the modification, the Fe content in the CSWFe increased from 1.3 % to 30.3 % wt. compared to CSW, at the SBET growth from 38 to 118 m2.g−1. The adsorption experiments were performed in a batch manner at laboratory temperature (20 °C), using the model solutions of CrO4 2-. The adsorption yield of CrO4 2- on the CSW up to 80 % was supported by the surface precipitate, while the adsorption on CSWFe indicated chemisorption via the inner-sphere surface complexes with an adsorption efficiency of 99 %. The adsorption data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich models, where the adsorption capacity reached 0.06 mmol.g−1 for CrO4 2- – CSW system and 0.35 mmol.g−1 for CrO4 2- – CSWFe system. Pseudo-second-order kinetics most accurately described the adsorption process. The standard leaching procedure of saturated CSW and CSWFe proved a high stability of CrO4 2- – CSWFe system, classifying it as an inert waste. The CSWFe seemed to be a promising sorbent of CrO4 2- usable in remediation technologies.',\n",

Our study shows that consumer waste is far more efficiently recovered in India than what has been reported in literature until now. The waste recovery takes place in multiple-stages and the final waste that reaches the municipal corporation mostly comprises of biodegradable waste, inerts and highly non-recyclable waste. Households, itinerant waste merchants and garbage collectors in India jointly recover 1.2–2.4 million tonnes of newspapers, 2.4–4.3 million tonnes of cardboard and mixed paper, 6.5–8.5 million tonnes of plastic, more than1.3 million tonnes of glass, more than 2.6 million tonnes of metal waste and 4–6.2 million tonnes of other recyclable material per year.

However, plastic cannot be essentially decomposed in the nature and thus led to inevitable damage to the environment. The study aims to recycle thermoplastic materials to attain the purposes of recycling, reuse, and sustainability. Polypropylene (PP) and toughening thermoplastic polyurethane (TTPU) are melt-blended for two cycles, which a small amount of compatibilizer (i.e. polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride, PP-g-MA) is added during the process. The morphology and mechanical properties of the PP/MA/TTPU blends are then measured and investigated. SEM images show that without the compatibilizer, TTPU particles demonstrate a dispersive phase in PP matrix. The presence of compatilizer improves the incompatible situation between TTPU and PP. The impact test results have proven that the incorporation of 20\\u202fwt% of TTPU and 5\\u202fwt% of compatibilizer helps to improve the interphase problem, thereby yielding the impact strength of 63.01\\u202fJ/g. The tensile strength test results show that the presence of PP compensates for the insufficient rigidity and high production cost of TTPU. The flexural strength test results show that PP with high stiffness synergizes to the softness and flexural performance of TTPU. It is expected that using the secondary recovery process obtains the added value and sustainable use of plastic products, which is helpful to the sustainable development of the earth.',\n",

All studied materials used in the road construction, including crushed rock, contained concentrations of several elements exceeding the guideline values recommended by the Swedish EPA for total element concentrations for waste materials used in constructions. Despite that, leaching from the road construction under field conditions in general was relatively low. The leachates from the recycled materials contained higher concentrations of several constituents than the leachates from the reference section with crushed rock. The leaching of the elements of interest (Cr, Mo, Ni, Zn) reached peak concentrations during the second and fourth (Cu) years and decreased over the observation period to levels below the Swedish recommended values. Carbonation of the concrete aggregates caused a substantial but short-term increase in the leaching of oxyanions such as chromate. The environmental risks related to element leaching are highest at the beginning of the road life. Ageing of materials or pre-treatment through leaching is needed prior to their use in construction to avoid peak concentrations. Also, the design of road constructions should be adjusted so that recycled materials are covered with low-permeability covers, which would minimize the exposure to atmospheric precipitation and weathering.',\n",

In this context, a novel process is developed to realize the recovery of spent LiMn2O4 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) via one-step pyrolysis and reductant-free acid leaching. The leaching efficiencies of lithium and manganese are respectively 99.9% and 99.4% under the optimal pyrolysis conditions: a temperature of 500 °C, a nitrogen flow rate of 50 mL/min, and a pyrolysis time of 60 min. The analysis of thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy indicates volatilization of electrolyte and decomposition of LiPF6 occur in the temperature range of 100–180 °C. When the temperature rises from 180 to 800 °C, high molecular weight polymers (binder and separator) are degraded into pyrolytic gas and oil. LiMn2O4 is deconstructed and reduced to MnO and Li2CO3 under the synergistic effect of pyrolytic gas and anode graphite. The harmful fluorine and phosphorus are absorbed by Ca(OH)2 solution to avoid environmental hazards. The results suggest that the process integrated pyrolysis and aicd leaching is efficient, environmental-friendly, and low-cost for recycling spent LiMn2O4 LIBs.',\n",

The two-step optimization framework starts with a Fuzzy Inference System methodology for scenario generation that faces the lack of information, and the necessity of estimate the expected operation cost and environmental impact. Then we use generated scenarios into the epsilon-constraint method which solves a multi-objective model to obtain a relevant set of solutions. After solving the second optimization model, we propose to analyze the robustness of the achieved redesign solutions considering a customer satisfaction approach. The computational experiments show that our proposed framework supports better the inclusion of scenarios for redesigning the plastic recycling supply chain. Furthermore, we study a real-life plastic recycling problem in Cuba which demonstrates that the framework is able to support the redesign decision making with robust solutions sensitive to the changes of the studied uncertain parameters.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of hazardous materials like plastic waste can be improved by adding value to viable biomass candidates. The current study is focused on lychee and plastic waste co-pyrolysis for the production of energy and chemicals. Based on this knowledge of the subject matter sample mixture was pyrolysed at four different heating rates: 10 °C min−1, 20 °C min−1, 30 °C min−1, and 40 °C min−1. To establish the pyrolysis reaction process, the data was subjected to kinetic modelling, which predicted thermodynamic parameters. The co-pyrolysis standard method of lychee and plastic waste demonstrated 83% of thermal degradation was achieved. This result proves that the co-pyrolysis of lychee waste and waste plastics can increase the output of bio-oil, reduce carbon coking, improve profitability and cost competitiveness, make industrial production possible and environmentally friendly. The kinetic parameters, such as average activation energy, pre-exponential factors, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, were shown to be 64 kJ mol−1 to 71 kJ mol−1, 102 s−1 to 1011 s−1, 58 kJ mol−1 to 65 kJ mol−1 and 299 kJ mol−1 to 308 kJ mol−1. The obtained quantitative synergetic kinetic and thermodynamic attributes of lychee and plastic waste may indicate its potential for bioenergy generation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The world is witnessing an unprecedented generation and accumulation of fiber-plastic wastes resulting in various challenges due to inconsistency, waste-stream heterogeneity, conveying issues, self-heating, and difficulty in pelletization. This study presents a novel pilot-scale system that integrates torrefaction and extrusion to convert mix fiber-plastic waste into fuel pellets. The produced pellets have low cost, high heating value, better uniformity, and low environmental impact. They can be used as solid fuels or as feedstock for pyrolysis and gasification. To evaluate the pellet cost and its environmental impact, we performed Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The TEA integrates research findings from the torrefaction-extrusion project with the techno-economic models and estimates the costs, energy consumption, and mass balances for pelletizing and torrefaction. The analysis indicates that the baseline cost of producing uniform pellets is about $55.28/dry tonne (2020$). LCA results indicate that the torrefied product has cradle-to-gate embodied greenhouse gas emissions that are net negative, although they are higher than a comparable forest-derived woodchip product. Fossil energy demand for the torrefied product is lower than the forest-derived chip, indicating the torrefied product has strong potential for use as an environmentally beneficial feedstock for future processing.',\n",

In recent years, although TISW in China has slowed down, the ‘hidden’ inflow is still relatively prominent by our comparison of the data between the major outflow countries/regions and that of China. Based on China’s institutional environment and evolution path, this study has identified the government as the main body of the TISW governance in China,and the classified supervision of TISW as its basis, with relevant government departments being empowered and coordinated by the law to constantly optimize the governance procedures by promoting the pre-entry checking,port supervising and the self-disciplined compliance of stakeholders. Based on the gravity model and the unbalanced short panel data of 41 kinds of TISW with 6-digit HS coding from 12 major outflow countries/regions in the period of 2012 - 2017, this empirical analysis by the two-way fixed effect static panel data model and the GMM dynamic panel data model respectively shows that the governance from the Chinese government has a significant impact on the reduction of the volume of TISW. Besides, the significant positive coefficient of GDP also shows that China’s economic growth results in a certain demand for recyclable solid waste, but the variables of TISW catalogue adjustment and international cooperation are not significant. Therefore,in order to further enhance the efficiency of TISW governance, it is suggested that: ① The classified supervision of TISW should be up-graded and the identification standards and procedures of TISW should also be scientifically optimized by the cooperation of relevant functional departments. ② The TISW governance system at China Customs should be continuously improved by focusing on the pre- and post-entry checking and credit management of stakeholders. ③ Multi-channel international cooperation and information exchange should be promoted to achieve timely risk prevention and more effective post-entry supervision.',\n",

       " {'context': 'It has been recognized that a proper and sustainable management strategy might help prevent the risks of leaching from waste portable batteries (WPBs), which are an important waste stream, and aid the conservation of raw materials. Unlike existing studies on WPB management, which focus mainly on emissions, this case study uses a resource-oriented approach to thoroughly analyze the performance of a WPB collection and recycling scheme. This study focused on the WPB take-back and recycling system managed by Bebat in Belgium. Life cycle assessment was conducted using three different existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods representing three different perspectives: Cumulative Exergy Extracted from the Natural Environment; Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), split into impact categories called ADPelements and ADPfossilfuels; and damage to Resource Cost. A new LCIA method, the criticality-based impact assessment method, has also been introduced to cover the socioeconomic aspects of natural resource consumption. The performance of the mixed waste (i.e., batteries, flashlights) collection and sorting system was assessed from 2011 to 2013. This analysis showed that in 2012, the use of collection receptacles made of plastic bags with 30% recycled content, instead of non-recycled paper or cardboard with 30% recycled content, was one of the main reasons for the low impact of the whole system from all assessment perspectives. The performance of entire take-back and recycling system for alkaline and zinc-carbon (ZnC) batteries, the two most popular portable batteries, was subsequently analyzed and benchmarked against two incineration scenarios: with and without bottom ash recovery. The comparisons of the four LCIA methods show differing results. The most prominent result is that the ADPelements score of the recycling scenario is 7–9 times lower than that of the incineration scenario, mainly due to metals (i.e., iron and zinc) savings via recycling. The recycling system requires 17–52% less material criticality, but extracts 13–18% more exergy from the natural environment and has a higher ADPfossilfuels score (about 14–16%) than the incineration system. These comparisons indicate that although the alkaline/ZnC battery management system run by Bebat does not reduce consumption of all resources, especially fossil fuels and land, it is beneficial in terms of minerals and metals savings. To further improve the efficiency and environmental performance of the collection system, different measures were implemented. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impacts of those measures on the mixed waste collection and sorting system and the alkaline/ZnC battery take-back and recycling system. The results suggested that a combination of different measures, especially reducing the number of receptacles used and enhancing their environmental performance, can considerably reduce the resource footprint.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Construction and demolition waste are one of the largest waste streams generated in the EU by volume. They consist of materials such as concrete, bricks, gypsum, wood, glass, metals, foams, plastics, solvents, asbestos, asphalt, and excavated soil. Nowadays, many of them can be recycled, some even endlessly. This research attempts to contribute to the non-destructive characterization of such a waste with a novel method using terahertz radiation. By combining terahertz imaging and spectroscopy, we performed analytical characterization of selected building materials. The results demonstrate that terahertz technology allows an inside view into some of the non-conducting building materials. THz imaging can detect and visualize the organic solvents in the insulation material, which are often disposed of together with construction and demolition waste. It can also visualize the content of foreign objects or hazardous and toxic substances, which is important for their separation in the recyclate according to the type of the material. Furthermore, THz spectra reveal some spectral lines that can differentiate between different plastics and polymers within the frequency range of 1.0–4.5 THz due to different material structures and chemical compositions. Such results significantly contribute to the decision of which product meets all the standards, which can be returned to the production process due to irregularities or may be disposed of as waste. The only way to reduce construction and demolition waste in the future is to encourage the adoption of innovative technologies like terahertz spectroscopy in combination with traditional methods. This approach can bring some changes also to the construction design philosophy toward more sustainable buildings with minimum end-of-life demolition.',\n",

This paper was aimed to investigate the influence of light fiber modification and fiber loadings (5–15 wt%) on the thermal, mechanical and physical properties of post-consumer high-density polyethylene (pHDPE)/sugarcane bagasse (SB) biocomposites. Three types of SB fibers were used, namely raw, washed and alkali-treated SB with sodium hydroxide. These coupling agent-free biocomposites were prepared via extrusion and followed by hot/cold pressing. Based on thermogravimetric analysis results, the thermal stability of biocomposites was not remarkably affected by the both fiber types and loading, however, the influence on the residues left after decomposition was shown. By incorporating raw SB onto pHDPE matrix without coupling agent, tensile strength (14.0–16.4 MPa) decreased but it was recovered upon alkali treatment (only for 5 wt% at 20.8 MPa) which was increased by 12% as compared to neat matrix (18.5 MPa). Interestingly, the stiffness of biocomposites increased linearly with fiber loading, as indicated by increment of experimental Youngs modulus results up to 515.5 MPa than that of pHDPE (302.2 MPa). As compared to raw SB fiber biocomposite, the alkali-treated biocomposite exhibited the lowered water absorption percentages of <2% weight gain after 48 h immersion.',\n",

Compound 1 was characterized by spectroscopic techniques (FTIR and NMR) and micro elemental analysis. Structural parameters, IR and NMR spectral data of compound 1 were obtained by DFT/B3LYP/6–311++G(d,p) method, considering two possible stable tautomeric forms as tetraketo and diketo-dienol. For detailed evaluation, theoretical IR and NMR data of compound 1 were compared with experimental ones. Results show that compound 1 predominantly exists in tetraketo form in solid state and DMSO. In this study, for the first time, a coupling component that can be used in the synthesis of azo dyes is obtained from TPDH, a degradation product of PET. This idea can lead to a significant contribution to saving raw materials in the industry and preventing environmental pollution caused by waste PET.',\n",

Foamed ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) is no exception as chemical cross-linking limits recyclability. Here, we demonstrate that we can readily control the kinetics of the cross-linking networks by changing the usage and variety of linkages with the introduction of reversible transesterification to construct EVA vitrimer. EVA vitrimer foams are prepared by physical foaming or chemical foaming. We suggest two strategies for the recycling of EVA vitrimer foams by re-joining and re-foaming. EVA vitrimers could switch states from the bulk vitrimer material to the foam material repeatedly through a re-foaming strategy, and EVA vitrimer foams can be cut-and-reunited through a re-joining approach. The change in the mechanical properties of the recycled vitrimer foams proves the importance of the reaction kinetics of dynamic covalent chemistry. These findings will stimulate further sustainable developments in the designing and recycling of polymeric foams.',\n",

Concrete brittleness can be reduced by adding various fibres to the concrete mix, whereby a composite material called fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) is created. This paper examines the effectiveness of recycled steel fibres (obtained from machining process discards) in increasing the ductility of concrete. Basic information on fibre reinforced concrete, including fibre types, the influence of a steel fibre addition on the mechanical properties of the material and the methodology of testing the main flexural properties of FRC according to different standards, is provided. The effect of a fibre addition was examined for three groups of test specimens differing in their fibres. A series made of plain concrete was prepared as the reference. In the other two groups the concrete matrix was reinforced with identical volume fractions of two types of steel fibres. Typical hook-end fibres were used in the first series while proposed recycled fibres were used in the second series. Fundamental mechanical properties such as: compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength and equivalent flexural strength were tested on cube and beam specimens. Additionally, the distribution of strains in the middle cross section of the beams reinforced with the recycled steel fibres and subjected to bending was determined. The potential utilization of recycled steel fibres as a substitute for the fibres commonly used to reinforce concrete is investigated and discussed.',\n",

Sums of seven indicator-PCBs (I-PCB7: PCB-28, -52, -101, -118, -138, -153 and -180) were highest in plastic waste (3700 ±1800 μg/kg, n=15), waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (1300 ± 400 μg/kg, n=12) and fine vehicle fluff (1800 ± 1400 μg/kg, n=4) and lowest in glass waste, combustibles, bottom ash and fly ash (0.3 to 65 μg/kg). Concentrations in leachate water varied from 1.7 to 2900 ng/L, with higher concentrations found at vehicle and WEEE handling facilities. Particles in leachate water exhibited similar PCB sorption properties as solid waste collected on site, with waste-water partitioning coefficients ranging from 105 to 107. I-PCB7 in air samples collected at the sites were mostly in the gas phase (100–24000 pg/m3), compared to those associated with particles (9–1900 pg/m3). In contrast, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in the same samples were predominantly found associated with particles (e.g. sum of 10 brominated diethyl ethers, ΣBDE10, associated with particles 77–194,000 pg/m3) compared to the gas phase (ΣBDE10 6–473 pg/m3). Measured gas-phase I-PCB7 concentrations are less than predicted, assuming waste-air partitioning in equilibrium with predominant waste on site. However, the gas-particle partitioning behavior of PCBs and BFRs could be predicted using an established partitioning model for ambient aerosols. PCB emissions from Norwegian waste handling facilities occurred primarily in the form of atmospheric vapor or leachate particles.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Resources embedded in the waste streams are often not properly recovered and are mostly ended up in landfills or only recovered as energy via energy-from-waste (EfW) facilities. Innovative resource recovery from waste strategies are urgently needed to maximise resource efficiency, divert waste from landfills and reduce reliance on EfW. This study proposes a novel mechanical-biological treatment with valorisation concept (MBT-v) that combines material recovery and fuel production, as alternatives to EfW for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment. The polygeneration feature exhibited by the MBT-v system enhances resource efficiency and product diversification. The proposed MBT-v system involves valorisation of rejected materials from MBT into hydrogen by incorporating an additional gasification system. A comprehensive techno-economic assessment is conducted for the proposed MBT-v system and compared against a conventional MBT. The results reveal that the conventional MBT strongly relies on gate fees to be economically viable while it is heavily impacted by the rejects disposal cost. The analysis also shows that higher economic potential (36.4 M£/y) for MBT-v can be obtained compared to that of conventional MBT (3.4 M£/y) for a 100 kt/y residual MSW system. The minimum hydrogen selling price (MHSP) from the Gasification-H2 system is estimated to be at 3.4 £/kg (28.3 £/GJ), with potential for further reduction through upscaling the facility. This study concludes that producing high value product such as hydrogen (with the current assumed market price of hydrogen of 10 £/kg) can significantly improve the economic performance and minimise financial instability of the facilities. It is recommended that the scale and optimal configuration of MBT-v to be designed based on local conditions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Separation becomes a bottleneck of dealing with the enormous stream of waste plastics, as most of the extant methods can only handle binary mixtures. In this paper, a novel method that based on magnetic levitation was proposed for separating multiple mixed plastics. Six types of plastics, i.e., polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyamide 6 (PA6), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), were used to simulate the mixed waste plastics. The samples were mixed and immersed into paramagnetic medium that placed into a magnetic levitation configuration with two identical NdFeB magnets with like-poles facing each other, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to verify the separation outputs. Unlike any conventional separation methods such as froth flotation and hydrocyclone, this method is not limited by particle sizes, as mixtures of different size fractions reached their respective equilibrium positions in the initial tests. The two-stage separation tests demonstrated that the plastics can be completely separated with purities reached 100%. The method has the potential to be industrialised into an economically-viable and environmentally-friendly mass production procedure, since quantitative correlations are determined, and the paramagnetic medium can be reused indefinitely.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Fab labs, which offer small-scale distributed digital fabrication, are forming a Green Fab Lab Network, which embraces concepts of an open source symbiotic economy and circular economy patterns. With the use of industrial 3D printers capable of fused particle fabrication/ fused granular fabrication (FPF/FGF) printing directly from waste plastic streams, green fab labs could act as defacto recycling centers for converting waste plastics into valuable products for their communities. Clear financial drivers for this process have not been studied in the past. Thus, in this study the Gigabot X, an open source industrial 3D printer, which has been shown to be amenable to a wide array of recyclables for FPF/FGF 3D printing, is used to evaluate this economic potential. An economic life cycle analysis of the technology is completed comprised of three cases studies using FPF for large sporting equipment products. Sensitivities are run on the electricity costs for operation, materials costs from various feed stocks and the capacity factors of the 3D printers. The results showed that FPF/FGF 3D printing is capable of energy efficient production of a wide range of large high-value sporting goods products. In all cases, a substantial economic savings was observed when comparing the materials and energy related costs to commercial goods (even for customized goods). Using locally-sourced shredded plastic represented not only the best environmental option, but also the most economic. For the case study products analyzed even the lowest capacity factor (starting only one print per week) represented a profit when comparing to high-end value products. For some products the profit potential and return on investment was substantial (e.g. over 1000%) for high capacity use of a Gigabot X. The results clearly show that open source industrial FPF/FGF 3D printers have significant economic potential when used as a distributed recycling/manufacturing system using recyclable feed stocks in the green fab lab context.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The thermo-mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures are highly influenced by the properties of the asphalt binders. The poor performance of the asphalt binders can lead to several distresses in asphalt pavements such as rutting and fatigue cracking. One of the common approaches to mitigate the asphalt pavement distresses is modifying the asphalt binders, which can happen by using a wide variety of modifiers or additives. In this research, the effects of various amounts of a green composite modifier (CM) made from recycled materials on the performance of a base asphalt were investigated. In addition, using the same base binder, the performance of this modifier was compared with that of Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) which is the most common modifier used in many regions. The use of CM obtained from recycled materials can provide both environmental and economic benefits. It could also be expected to obtain technical improvements upon the addition of this modifier. The CM contained High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomers (EPDM), Ground Tire Rubber (GTR), and bitumen. The performance of the binders was evaluated by conducting a wide range of tests including penetration, softening point, viscosity, conventional performance grading, linear amplitude sweep, and multiple stress creep recovery. The findings from this research indicated that both modifiers improved the rheological properties of the binders. Moreover, although CM slightly showed negative impacts on the fatigue life, it was found to show comparable performance with that of SBS.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The short residence time of certain building materials, such as carpets, results in a notable waste stream that has the potential to be a resource for other material systems. In this work, we explore the utilization of post-consumer carpet calcium carbonate (PC4) consisting primarily of the material from carpet backing, which has thus far found few markets, as a potential mineral admixture in the production of concrete. The effects on mechanical and material properties are examined for concrete mixtures with PC4 used as 5 and 15% mass replacement of Portland cement, and PC4 used as 5 and 15% mass replacement of fine aggregates. The effects of PC4 on the slump, air content, unit weight, and setting times were assessed. Additionally, compressive strength, flexural strength, coefficient of thermal expansion, shrinkage, bulk density, void volume, and absorption were measured. Due to the known presence of antimony in PC4, leachate from cured specimens was examined. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions to manufacture the mixtures were quantified. The results indicate that PC4 can increase air content in concrete by 3.5–10% and decrease the unit weight by up to 11% in fresh concrete. PC4 also led to a loss in compressive strength by up to 60%. Thus, the findings indicate that it is possible to form a less dense, more porous concrete by using PC4 as a mineral constituent in concrete, but with some loss in performance. Through appropriate selection of applications or through supplementary treatment of PC4, it may find a suitable market in the concrete industry.',\n",

A mixture of plastic sheets containing food residues and rice husk was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization of approximately 204.4 °C for 30 min (hydrothermal30) and 60 min (hydrothermal60). The hydrothermally generated products (hydrolysates), either solid fractions (hydrochar60 and hydrochar30), liquid fractions (liquid60 and liquid30), and a mixture of thereof (solid-liquid-mix60 and solid-liquid-mix30) were further utilized via AD batch experiments alongside a control non-treated digester. The lignocellulosic biomass was effectively solubilized in solid- and liquid-fraction after hydrothermal30 by 1.04 and 1.50 times tCOD and by 1.72 and 1.47 times TVFAs than the corresponding hydrothermal60, respectively. Additionally, the hemicellulose contents in the solid hydrochar fractions were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by 86.10–93.47% over non-thermally treated biomass. The cumulative CH4 harvest improved by 1.4, 2.5, 2.1, 3.4, 6.6, and 10.0 times for hydrochar60, hydrochar30, solid-liquid-mix60, solid-liquid-mix30, liquid60, and liquid30 over the untreated control digester, respectively. Consequently, the recovery of two wastes to precious byproducts was affected by the hydrothermal carbonization times with the optimum condition at hydrothermal30 that exhibits a promising waste management option.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Chlorpyriphos is one of the major organophosphorus pesticides used widely to control a range of insect pests across several crops. This insecticide is hazardous to the environment and toxic to mammals, thus, it is essential to remove the same from the environment. Similarly, use of polythene is also increasing day by day. Therefore, it is highly important to identify ways to degrade chlorpyriphos and other pesticides from the environment. We studied the degradation of chlorpyriphos and polyethylene by Citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri) bacterial endosymbionts such as Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas cereus, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis. This investigation revealed that bacterial endosymbionts use the polythene as a source of carbon and solubilize them by their enzymatic machinery. The degradation of polyethylene by endosymbionts showed a significant reduction in weight of polyethylene sheet after 15, 30 and 45 days of treatment. The SEM images showed localized degradation of the polyethylene around the bacterial cells in the biofilm. Further, the tensile strength (percentage elongation) was significantly reduced after 45 days of incubation. The weight of paraffin wax showed significant reduction in B. cereus. A significant reduction in total amount of chlorpyriphos in soil was observed at an interval of 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment by the bacterial isolates. Among the bacteria, B. cereus and P. putida were found to be most effective. The results from this study show that endosymbionts can be significantly implicated in degrading chlorpyriphos and polyethylene from the environment.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This work develops an integer linear programming methodology for the optimal design of municipal solid waste recycling systems. The model considers all costs, in present values, concerning recycling of products, disposal of solid wastes, as well as closure and monitoring of the old landfill, and opening of a new one. Economic benefits include revenues coming from the selling of the recycled goods, and those originating from extending the life of the landfill. The model was applied to the city of Chania for the recycling of paper, glass, aluminum and organic residues (putrescible matter). Recycling brings about a significant reduction in the annual cost of solid waste management, as well as an increase in the life of the landfill. The optimal recycling scheme depends on the characteristics of the areas which the city has been devided into. For the residential and tourist areas the largest possible quantities of aluminum, paper and putrescible matter should be recycled, while for the commercial area only aluminum and paper. The model also allows the investigation of less optimistic scenaria, such as future reduction of recovered materials prices or limited absorption of these materials in the market.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In the European Union, which is increasingly oriented towards environmentally sustainable development, separate waste collection plays a crucial role. Over the years, the EU has produced several guidelines, programmes and directives aimed to build a green society and tone down the differences between, as well as within, Member States. In Italy, the waste management system is currently regulated by Legislative Decree 152/2006, through which European directives have been incorporated into the Italian law. The existing literature has focused on the effects of L.D. 152/2006 on Separate Waste Collection (SWC) rates; however, there are not previous studies on the effects of this decree on growth rates and on convergence process among regions in terms of SWC and its items (i.e., organic, plastic, paper, and glass). This paper aims to fill these gaps. For this purpose, we implement β- and σ-convergence analysis based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) on official Italian regional data over the period 2001–2018. Results show that Legislative Decree 152/2006 has two contrasting effects: on the one hand, it helped increase separate waste collection; on the other hand, it slowed down the convergence process in terms of separate waste collection among the Italian regions. However, the convergence process is characterised by different speeds across Italian macro-areas (Northern, Central, and Southern Italy), highlighting a three-speed country. To foster convergence, the national legislation should consider regional differences in terms of economic, infrastructural, institutional, social, and demographic characteristics.',\n",

Therefore, this study proposes an alternative reuse method for certain types of plastic waste (bottles and containers used for liquid storage that are processed using discrete fibers) in geotechnical construction projects. To this end, discrete polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers were randomly mixed with fine soil to modify their mechanical properties. The principal objective of this research was to study the mechanical behavior of a silty soil that was reinforced with aleatorily distributed PET fibers. To meet this objective, UU triaxial laboratory tests were performed on soil specimens with fiber contents of 0.0–1.0% of the soil dry weight. The test results indicated that the reinforced specimens presented an increment of shear strength that was associated with the increasing quantities of the PET fiber. Furthermore, the laboratory tests indicated that the reinforced soil had a greater deformation capacity, which can be a positive characteristic in some cases because the deformation capacity can reduce the risk of crack formation in certain soil layers for specific geotechnical problems. Finally, this reinforced soil presents interesting mechanical properties and could be used in structures that require a high deformation capacity, such as landfills, sewage treatment deposits and dams (among other uses), to prevent failures due to cracking and to prevent the possible leakage of contaminants or water. However, these issues are beyond the scope of this paper.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Microplastics are omnipresent in the terrestrial and aquatic environment, and are considered as a potentially serious threat to the biodiversity and ecosystem. Pollution of plastic debris and microplastics in the inland and marine environment has raised concerns in Bangladesh, which is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. This review summarizes the research progress on separation and characterization of microplastics, as well as their occurrence and sources in Bangladesh. Despite of the first total ban on plastic bags in the world introduced back in 2002, microplastics have been ubiquitously detected in the country's inland and marine environment, with the majority of them coming from secondary sources. The microplastics observed in Bangladesh were dominated by fibers, which were derived mainly from textile sources. Polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinylchloride (PVC) were the most abundant polymers found for microplastics in the marine and freshwater environment of Bangladesh. Along with the identified research priorities to improve the understanding on the ecotoxicological effect and fate of microplastics, extensive and in-depth studies are required to bridge the knowledge gaps to enable comprehensive risk assessment of microplastic pollution on local ecosystems and human health, while effective management of plastic wastes and their recycling are necessary to alleviate this problem in the country.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Increasing global plastic consumption and its related plastic waste have become a major concern in the world. Achieving sustainable development in the plastics industry requires a systematic insight into all the relevant life cycle phases of plastic products and their environmental impacts. This paper utilises the concepts of industrial ecology and the circular economy to evaluate the three key aspects of thermoset plastic materials and their overall life cycle comprehensively: i) Sustainable production, ii) Recycling to obtain secondary products, and iii) End-of-life behaviour. For all three aspects, their environmental impacts are evaluated additionally using the conceptual Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The industrial ecology approach, together with LCA is performed on a case study of melamine etherified resin (MER) fibre, which is a high value-added thermoset plastic, difficult to recycle, and, at the end-of-life, potentially emits hazardous compounds. The potential to sustainably produce MER fibre exclusively from renewable and waste sources is explored, closing the loop on the manufacturing and disposal phases. The hydrothermal decomposition of MER fibres into valuable compounds is investigated as a recycling technology. Regarding the end-of-life, a systematic assessment is conducted of the environmental impacts of discharging such material into soil and water bodies. Cleaner production of MER fibres shows the potential to reduce greenhouse gas footprint up to 67%, while analysis of sustainable recycling and disposal highlights important environmental hotspots.',\n",

The current study comprises two parts: a kinetic study and pyrolysis experiments using activator-assisted pyrolysis. The kinetic study was performed using the distributed activation energy model, and it revealed that the average activation energy for activated molecules was 7 kJ/mol lower than that for unactivated molecules. The pyrolysis experiment confirmed that the activation of molecules resulted in an enhanced gas production. In particular, the methane and ethene yields increased by 11 and 8 wt%, respectively, when molecules were activated. A higher flow rate of the product gas used as the fluidizing gas resulted in a decrease in the gas yield. CaO and Na2CO3 were used as absorbents for chlorinated compounds produced during pyrolysis to reduce the level of Cl in the oil. The absorbents, at first, changed the product distribution, enhancing the production of mono-aromatics. In particular, the benzene yield with Na2CO3 amounted to 10 wt%. The two absorbents were excellent in reducing the Cl content in oil. Between the two absorbents, Na2CO3 proved to be the better, reducing the Cl content to 65 ppm.',\n",

Seven possible reaction paths were designed and analyzed, and the thermodynamic parameters for all reactions were computed. The calculated results indicate that the bond dissociation energy values (BDEs) of C–C bonds on the main-chain are the smallest, followed by those of C–O bonds. The kinetics analysis indicates that the concerted reactions are obviously liable to occur rather than radical reactions in the initial thermal decomposition process. In the processes of initial reactions, all concerted reactions occurred by six-membered cyclic transition states (TSs) are more prone to carry out than those happened by four-membered cyclic transition states. The research results show that the primary products of PET dimer pyrolysis are terephthalic acid, vinyl terephthalate, CH3CHO and divinyl terephthalate. CH3CHO is mainly formed by a concerted reaction in the initial degradation process, and CO2 is mainly produced by the decarboxylation via a concerted reaction and CO is mainly produced by the decarbonylation of a radical in secondary degradation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With the increase in waste streams, industrial sorting has become a major issue. The main challenge is to minimise sorting errors to avoid serious recycling problems and significant quality degradation of the final recycled product. Making use of near infrared (NIR) technology, some industrialists have already designed sorting machines able to discriminate between several types of plastics with good reliability. However, these devices are not suited to dark plastics, which are very common in WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment). In order to overcome this obstacle, mid-wavelength infrared (MIR) technology can be used instead of NIR. Nevertheless, the new spectral range is poorer in terms of wavelength for some plastics of interest ( 2712 − 5274 n m ), which makes the sorting task harder in an industrial context where spectrum identification is subject to imprecision and uncertainty. This article shows the benefit of combining this promising optical technology with a cautious machine learning procedure to optimise recycling. When the information provided by the device regarding a plastic fragment to be sorted is insufficient to discriminate between candidate materials, the proposed procedure, taking advantage of the belief functions theory, blows the fragment into a container dedicated to more than one specific material. This cautious sorting enables the containers dedicated to the specific materials to contain less impurities, which leads to higher-quality secondary raw materials. The proposed sorting procedure is illustrated and compared with a more conventional approach using real industrial data.',\n",

The individual pyrolysis simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results. The co-pyrolysis simulation results show that coal promotes the primary decomposition of PE at low temperatures, but shows little effect on PE pyrolysis at high temperatures. It is also found that coal has little effect on PS pyrolysis during coal/PS co-pyrolysis at all given temperatures. PE and PS have no effects on coal pyrolysis at low temperatures, but significantly promote coal char decomposition and inhibit the secondary reactions of coal tar at high temperatures. The promoting effect of PS on coal pyrolysis is more pronounced than that of PE. The interaction mechanisms between coal and plastics are revealed by analyzing the distributions of H and OH radicals. The kinetic parameters for the individual pyrolysis of coal, PE and PS, as well as the co-pyrolysis of coal and PE/PS are determined using the first-order reaction model. The results suggest that the synergistic effect significantly reduces the activation energy for coal/PE co-pyrolysis, while has little effect on the activation energy for coal/PS co-pyrolysis.',\n",

The effects of metal species on the active radicals, organic yields, properties and compositions were explored. The Ru and Ti species, especially the low-valence titanium-oxides, increased atomic radicals, relieved the bottleneck of hydrogen transfer, and induced more volatiles into the radicals scale. The synergy of acid sites, metal species and NTP contributed to the integration of volatiles and exhibited promising potential in lowering oxygen and increasing organic yield. Specifically, TiHZ5 yielded the organic liquid of 58.73 % with the HHV of 38.73 MJ/kg, and RuHZ5 produced 51.70 % of organic liquid with the HHV of 36.96 MJ/kg. The synergy between SnHZ5 and NTP was so weak that it sacrificed partial yield to promote HHV. The Ru, Ti, and Sn modification increased the aromatic selectivity from 23.38 %–48.9 %, 72.14 % and 35.66 %, respectively, which caused the decrease of effective hydrogen to carbon ratios. Particularly, TiHZ5 gave the maximum MAHs selectivity of 64.19 % and minimum PAHs selectivity of 7.95 %. Besides, Ru, Ti and Sn modification decreased coking rate from 16.97 % to 7.04 %, 4.62 % and 8.46 %, respectively, and removal of coke became easier.

As the results, with the volume fractions of PET from 0.05 to 0.22, as the temperature is increased up to melting point temperature and above mold temperature, the relative permittivity is decreased as the temperature is increased. However over melting temperature up to the mold temperature, the relative permittivity is slightly increased as the temperature is increased. On the other hand, the dielectric loss and loss tangent are not affected by the temperature variance, and the dielectric loss and loss tangent are increased as the measurement frequency is increased. As the conclusions, at molding temperature 180°C (453K), the highest sensitivity of dielectric property is the relative permittivity. Meanwhile, the highest linearity relationship between PET volume fraction and predicted relative permittivity is achieved at the measurement frequency of 5MHz. From relative permittivity measurement in these conditions, the performance to distinguish PET volume fraction 0.05 from PE volume fraction 0.95 is achieved in the mixed melting polymer pellets.

First, the global warming potential (GWP) of commercial waste management was calculated. Second, the impacts of different waste fractions and the processes of waste management were recognised. Third, the key areas on which to focus when aiming to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of commercial waste management were determined. This study was conducted on the waste generated by a real hypermarket in South-East Finland and included eight different waste fractions. The waste treatment plants were selected based on the actual situation. Three different scenarios were employed to evaluate the environmental impact of managing mixed waste: landfilling, combustion and more accurate source separation. The GaBi software and impact assessment methodology CML 2001 were used to perform a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts associated with the waste management. The results indicated that the total GWP of commercial waste management could be reduced by 93% by directing the mixed waste to combustion instead of landfill. A further 5% GWP reduction could be achieved by more accurate source separation of the mixed waste. Utilisation of energy waste had the most significant influence (41–52%) on the total GWP (−880 to −860\\u202fkgCO2-eq./t), followed by landfilling of mixed waste (influence 15–23% on the total GWP, 430\\u202fkgCO2-eq./t), recycling polyethylene (PE) plastic (influence 18–21% on the total GWP, −1800\\u202fkgCO2-eq./t) and recycling cardboard (influence 11–13% on the total GWP, 51\\u202fkgCO2-eq./t). A key focus should be placed on treatment processes and substitutions, especially in terms of substitutions of energy waste and PE plastic. This study also clarified the importance of sorting PE plastic, even though the share of this waste fraction was not substantial. The results of this paper were compared to those of previous studies. The output of this analysis indicated that the total GWP can be significantly reduced by identifying an alternative recycling or incineration location for cardboard where it is used to substitute virgin material or replace fossil fuels respectively. In conclusion, it is essential to note that waste management companies have a notable influence on the emissions of commercial waste management because they choose the places at which the waste fractions are treated and utilised.',\n",

The contents of oxygenated hydrocarbons were decreased in oil from 4.6 and 9.4\\u202fwt.% per mass of PET-12 and PET-28, respectively, to undetectable levels. After catalytic cracking, the oil samples had similar contents of gasoline, diesel and heavy oil/wax fractions. The non-condensable gas was converted into MWCNTs over 0.9\\u202fwt.% Ni supported on CaCO3 (700\\u202f°C). The type of plastic packaging influenced the yields (2.4 and 1.5\\u202fwt.% per mass of PET-12 and PET-28, respectively) and the properties of MWCNTs due to the differences in gas composition. Regarding the electrocatalytic application, both MWCNTs from PET-12 and PET-28 outperformed commercial MWCNTs and Pt-based electrodes during oxygen evolution reaction, suggesting that MWCNTs from flexible plastic packaging can potentially replace conventional electrode materials.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper presents the direct combustion with energy recovery as a treatment method to wet waste (waste mixed and contaminated with organic fractions) generated from the selective collection in Brazil, based on its thermochemical characterization, searching for a final destination different from dumps, and decreasing the waste amount sent to landfills in the country. The energy recovery potential was calculated from the physical, chemical, and thermal characterization of products found in the waste stream grouped into five combustible categories (Organic matter, Sanitary waste, Paper/cardboard/Tetra Pak®, Plastics, and Textiles). The thermochemical characterization, the waste’s behavior as a feedstock for energy power plants, the energy recovery potential, and GHG emissions avoided from three scenarios of electric power efficiency (18, 25, and 30%) were studied. The results show that the combustion with energy recovery could be used as a treatment method because of the Brazilian MSW characteristics as a solid fuel, such as a lower heating value of 7.22±1.76 MJ.kg−1, moisture content of 49.19±10.05%, and an ash content of 14.23±6.71%; highlighting that in some regions of the country, there is the possibility of using auxiliary fuels for waste combustion. In this way, MSW combustion facilities could contribute an additional 3% of electrical energy to the national energy matrix from the use of at least 67% of the MSW collected. Furthermore, annual emissions of about 1 million tonnes of CH4 (24 million tonnes of CO2-eq) and around 140 million cubic meters of dumps could be avoided, dependent on the gross electrical efficiency used in Waste-to-Energy technology.',\n",

Within this context, agricultural wastes and biopolymers offer suitable alternatives to be used as additive or reinforcement agents of polymer matrices. There is a wide variety of biocomposites or agro-composites containing natural fibers or solid residues of agricultural products as an additive, but there are not reported studies on agro-composites formed by the combination of synthetic petroleum plastics, and solid wastes from sugar beet working as a reinforcement of the polymer matrix. This work presents a new agro-composite synthesized by combining linear low-density polyethylene, one of the most used and versatile thermoplastic materials, and “Carbocal®“, an organic-inorganic residue from the sugar beet processing industry. The synthesis of the composite is direct and does not require the use of grafting, adhesion polymers or coupling agents. The tests carried out showed the improved mechanical performance of the composite compared with the neat polymer, proving the reinforcement role played by the waste within the polymer matrix. Therefore, this new agro-composite has potential applications replacing some highly demanded synthetic petroleum plastics. Additionally, the composite can be processed by extrusion and injection, according to its thermo-mechanical properties. Indeed, the composite was successfully injected with packaging purposes. The use of this new agro-composite contributes to recycle agricultural wastes otherwise hardly recovered and valorized, reducing the C02 footprint and favoring the use of high quality secondary-raw materials, well aligned with the circular economy.',\n",

Each year, large amounts of aluminium-plastics packaging waste are being generated with record up to 20,000 tons worldwide and this value is continuously growing. However, its recycling rate is still restricted in 20% due to lack of appropriate separation technology.

Commonly used metallised composite plastic, post-consumer face mask sheet packaging bags, composed of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and a layer of aluminium foil is investigated as raw metallised plastic packaging waste material. Thermo-delamination of this waste above temperature of 500\\u202f°C can achieve approximate 67\\u202fwt% gasification and left a 33\\u202fwt% solid residue constituted by black char and aluminium. Followed by a refinement treatment, a high-quality metallic aluminium weight around 30\\u202fwt% of the raw waste was finally isolated. This aluminium product was proved to have a high purity up to 95\\u202fwt% and a nanoscale oxidation surface by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer and inductively coupled plasma techniques. Meanwhile, the gaseous products generated from decomposition of the plastic components contained in the waste are mainly composed of aromatic and methylene group hydrocarbons which can be easily reformed into high efficient fuel gases like methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide for energy uses. This innovative thermo-delamination process offered a cleaner route for production of high quality aluminium from metallised plastic packaging waste and achieved 97\\u202fwt% transformation of waste into value-added resources.',\n",

In the developed technology, ultrasonic treatment was used to accelerate the breakage rate of adhesive bonding and molecular forces between the layers of packaging composite, eventually delaminating all layers as received (aluminum, plastic, etc.) or in the form of residues (printing ink and solidified polymer). The delamination process was conducted on six preliminary crushed types of full-size blisters) with different structure, size, and color at the temperature range of 40\\u202f°C - 80\\u202f°C. Solidified polymer was recovered in the shape of flakes from the solvent after its saturation by CO2 under cooling. Metallographic microscope, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis, and Differential scanning calorimetry were used to examine the materials recovered from each blister type as well as the changes in the solvent before, after CO2 addition, and CO2 removal to regenerate the solvent. The results showed that all blister packaging types had distinctive structure in terms of morphology and chemical composition. Aluminum was the main metallic element found in all types as a single or a double foil layer with average presence ∼17\\u202fwt.% and average purity 81%. At the same time, polymers Polyvinyl Chloride, Polypropylene, Polyethylene terephthalate, Polyvinylidene Chloride, and Low-density polyethylene were the main components in forming film and coating layers. The results showed that the recovered Polyvinyl Chloride and Polypropylene had good thermal stability and glass transition temperature. Lastly, the economic assessment of the developed approach was done to discuss the possibility of the new technique integration into Circular Economy system.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Conventionally, material inputs to industries come from either natural resources or intermediate products. With the increasing attention on greening the industrial process, municipal solid waste (MSW) can be separated and utilized as inputs to large-scale industries. As such, waste flows need to be managed to meet the requirements of industries by considering both quality and scale. Small scales of municipal recycling centers (MRCs) for pre-treating recyclable wastes often lead to higher pre-treatment cost and lower recycling efficiencies. Theoretically, appropriate facility scale and recycling boundary should be based upon a balanced consideration between economies of scale and transportation costs. However, only a few empirical studies on recycling boundaries have been conducted. Existing modeling studies are mostly case studies for planning purposes and do not theoretically examine the mechanisms and factors that determine recycling boundary. Under such a circumstance, this paper fills such a gap by quantitatively seeking the determinants for recycling boundaries and the related mechanism. An optimization model applying on the recycling of waste plastics is developed and tested in the Tokyo Metropolitan Region (TMR) in Japan. The results indicate two determinants for recycling boundary at the regional level: spatial density of separated wastes and the ratio of unit transportation cost to unit treatment cost. Separated wastes that are collected in low spatial density and have a low ratio of unit transportation cost to unit treatment cost should be better recycled in a large region. The finding implies that regional recycling networks should have multiple layers designed for different types of wastes due to the differences in their spatial density, unit transportation cost and unit treatment cost.',\n",

The present work is concerned with the thermo-mechanical analysis of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under uniaxial tensile loading. The main focus is to propose a one-dimensional phenomenological model able to describe the influence of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical behavior. Tensile tests were performed over a wide range of temperatures (from 25°C to 100°C). Each experiment was performed under controlled strain rate varying from 7.25 × 10−5 s−1 to 7.25 × 10−3 s−1 in steps. It is shown that only one tensile test performed at three different temperatures is necessary to fully identify experimentally all material parameters that arise in the theory. Thus, with this experimental procedure, the number of tests used to evaluate the mechanical properties of recycled HDPE is significantly reduced. The experiments are compared with the model predictions and show good agreement.',\n",

Treating plastics using chemical methods adds up chemicals into the environment with toxic byproducts. The physical method, a slow and expensive process, is not the better alternative. The process should rely on the environmental sources producing eco-friendly byproducts. The byproducts such as biofuel could be utilized for a sustainable environment, but the conversion of plastics into biofuel is expensive. Hence, biodegradation is the better, sustainable, and cost-effective process for plastic/any other pollutant removal. The study focuses on the construction of Winogradsky column using dumpsite soil. The column amended with Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) serves as a carbon source for native microbes. The utilization of microbes in every niche for the degradation enhances the degradation of LDPE. The Otteri soil resulted in 35.4 ± 0.3%, while Kodungaiyur and agriculture soil show 29.7 ± 0.6% and 19.8 ± 0.8%. The AFM analysis shows the disruption of smooth LDPE surface by forming ridges and grooves, which further confirms the occurrence of degradation. The FTIR analysis shows the incorporation of OH, CO, and other CO–O–CO in the CH backbone of LDPE. The oxidation of LDPE will aid in cleavage and result in the process of weathering. The tensile strength decreased after LDPE treatment (23.88 MPa - control, 22.50 MPa – Kodungaiyur, and 14.92 MPa – Otteri). Thus, utilizing the native microbes present in every niche enhances the degradation of pollutants.',\n",

Regardless of the numerous potential derivatives from the waste PKS such as activated carbon, pulverized shells, liquified fumes etc., there still exists the problem of its indiscriminate disposal or incineration without energy recovery thereby creating both economic and environmental concerns. This review is therefore aimed at presenting the state of the art on the numerous applications of PKS as a carbon–neutral, biodegradable, affordable and available residual component of oil palm processing, which if properly maximized will be a value-added precursor to solving the associated disposal and environmental challenges. Findings from most studies demonstrate that PKS has great potentials as a bioabsorbent, abrasive, detoxifier, antibacteria, antifungi and antioxidant material as well as a biofuel for syngas and biodiesel production. Other applications of PKS include reinforcement for polymer and metallic composites and aggregates in construction and ceramics. Industrial uses of PKS in agriculture, oilrefining, healthcare, fashion, glass, drugs and rubber vulcanizate production were also discussed. The suitability of PKS for other engineering applications were also highlighted with recommendation for further exploitation suggested.

The co-fracture products under different heating rates were tested. The main product was 1-hexadecanol, 2-methyl-, which had the highest yield of 44.66 wt % at the heating rate of 25 °C/min. Diisobutyl phthalate was the main hazardous product, which had highest yield was 9.75 wt % at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Only at the heating rate of 30 °C/min, no hazardous substance was produced. Different energy supply in the system was the main reason for the different products. Molecule co-fracture was employed in this study to dispose organics in waste solar cells, which provides guidance for the disposal of waste solar cells to avoid environmental pollution.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A high performance fluoride adsorbent was prepared for the removal of fluoride from industrial wastewater by calcination and polyacrylic acid impregnation. Through batch experiments, the removal capacity of the adsorbent for fluorine and the influence of key factors (calcination temperature, dosage of polyacrylic acid, pH, initial fluorine concentration and dosage of adsorbent) on the efficiency of the adsorbent for fluoride removal was investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity and removal of efficiency were 98.61 mg/g and 98.7%, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm studies showed that the pseudo second order model and Langmuir isotherm model fitted this adsorption process better. Moreover, the mechanism of F− removal by CS, C-CS, PAA@C-CS were further analyzed by SEM, EDS, XRD and FTIR. F- in wastewater were found to be adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent through electrostatic interaction, ion exchange and surface coordination. Recovery is achieved by desorption of the adsorbent material by NaOH (0.1 M). As a highly resourced and eco-friendly adsorbent for removal of F− from industrial wastewater, PAA@C-CS has a promising application for controlling industrial water pollution.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis (CSMP) reactor coupled with an ex-situ catalytic bed was developed for the conversion of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to high-grade fuels. Effects of catalyst-to-reactant ratio and feeding rate on product yield and chemical selectivity were studied. The CSMP of LLDPE produced up to 84.1 wt.% condensate product composed of hydrocarbon fuels. With the assistance of the ex-situ catalytic process with HZSM-5, more refined chemicals dominated by gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5–C12 hydrocarbons) were observed. When the catalyst-to-reactant ratio was 15 % and the feeding rate was 6 g/min, the condensate oil with a high higher heating value (45.23 MJ/kg) showed the highest selectivity of gasoline-range hydrocarbons (98.0 %). The pyrolysis processes yielded ethylene as the main gas product. With the addition of HZSM-5, propylene and propane were the primary gas components. The plausible pathway for the conversion of LLDPE mainly proceeded through radical mechanism for pyrolysis and carbenium ion mechanism for catalysis was elaborated. The potential net energy gain increased from 34.16 MJ/kg to 48.91 MJ/kg with growing feeding rate from 6 g/min to 30 g/min.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The application of wastes and their recycled extractions to develop green construction materials attracts researchers worldwide owing to the high pessimistic environmental impact of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) industry. The current review manuscript represents an endeavour to reassess applications of abandoned electrical and electronic wastes, i.e. E-wastes, as supplementary material to develop a variety of green concretes for construction and infrastructure industries. The principal objective of this piece of review writing includes an existing and state of the art knowledge of these modern, complex, valuable but hazardous elements enclosing wastes by employing them as substitution of natural fine or coarse aggregates in concrete manufacturing. This is a new-fangled, an innovative and revolutionary concept in the direction of development of sustainable and cost-effective green concretes. Not only that, physical, chemical and metallurgical recycling processes of E-wastes, their advantages and disadvantages with thermal, strength, and durability parameters of E-wastes incorporated green concrete, as well as impacts of hazardous substances, have also been assessed. This paper also flashes a light not merely on an application of E-wastes glass of cathode ray tubes with cement paste, mortar and concrete but also an appraisal of the utilization of E-wastes materials in a bituminous mix. Also, the use of non-biodegradable recovered E-wastes plastics is reviewed as partial substitution of natural coarse or fine ingredients through this “Urban Mining” approach. This review will lend a hand to promote sustainable and affordable development of green concrete incorporating E-wastes in the construction industry and help to resolve the impasses of degradation of natural restricted aggregate resources as well as contaminations of environment, soil, and groundwater due to landfilling and of course, to safeguard the health of lives on the globe.',\n",

Cyclic utilizing the recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) is inevitable. This paper uses the steel-fiber-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (SRAC) as filling to manufacture CFST columns, called SRACFST columns. A comprehensive study for the axial behavior of 39 slender SRACFST columns is presented. The experimental parameters are the slenderness ratio (λ), steel fiber volume (v), quality replacement rate of regenerated aggregate (RAR), concrete strength grade and diameter-thickness ratio of steel tube (D/t). Failure mode, axial load-lateral deflection behavior, axial load-strain response and ultimate capacity are researched. The results show that slender SRACFST columns present the similar compressive behavior to the common slender CFST columns. The defect of RAC can be compensated by the confinement effect of steel tube and the bridging effect of steel fibers. With the rise in slender ratio, the confinement of steel tube and steel fibers is faded out.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Plastic represents a significant fraction of the total packaging waste, and its management is an important issue that should embrace recycling techniques for material recovery. Support decisions in the area of waste management can be made using the life cycle approach, which is commonly used to identify the environmental impacts of recycling and can give information to put environmental issues into a wide perspective. This study evaluates how much an innovative recyclable package is environmentally preferable to an alternative package that is not recyclable considering that both are produced from recycling post-consumer PET bottles. Two products were chosen to perform the study. The first product is a package produced with a multilayer film and whose end-of-life scenario includes land-filling and incineration. The second product is an innovative package produced employing a mono-material whose end-of-life scenario comprises recycling, land-filling and incineration. This study explains that the utilisation of recycled materials represents the initial effort to reduce environmental burdens and shows that using recycled materials combined with specific additives that assure the recyclability of the final product leads to a better environmental performance. The package produced employing a recyclable mono-material film is more environmental advisable than the multilayer for all of the impact categories analysed. The results obtained are also tested using a sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty analysis and confirm the results of the life cycle impact assessment. The study demonstrates the pertinence of the life cycle approach to assess whether a prevention activity to reduce waste production is actually environmental sustainable and to provide decision-making support in the field of packaging waste management.',\n",

Its recycling at the source of generation can not only reduce waste transportation costs but also prevent harmful air emissions. Therefore, the present study was planned to investigate the performance of a decentralized household composting system for onsite recycling of source-segregated HWBW. The study was carried out in the recycled plastic drums (capacity\\u202f=\\u202f100\\u202fL). The effect of waste turning and addition of microbial inoculum and bulking agent (garden waste) on the composting process was examined. The results showed that proper provisions for aeration and periodic waste turning are necessary to produce good quality compost. The addition of a suitable microbial inoculum can reduce duration of waste stabilization. During composting, the peak temperature was found greater than 55\\u202f°C for 3–6 days and the compost yield (<4\\u202fmm fraction) was 18%–20%. The phytotoxicity tests results showed that the growth of cress plants is not affected in the presence of 20% of compost mixed in soil. One-time addition of inoculum at the start of composting process was found sufficient for completion of the active decomposition period within 30 days. Based on the above results, two-drum systems can be suggested as feasible option to produce compost from HWBW.',\n",

Here, we used a screening approach on hundreds of plastic waste-associated samples and discovered a marine bacterial community capable of efficiently colonizing and degrading both poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polyethylene (PE). Using absolute quantitative 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods, we obtained corresponding abundance and purified cultures of three bacterial strains that mediated plastic degradation. We further performed numerous techniques to characterize the efficient degradation of PET and PE by the reconstituted bacterial community containing these three bacteria. Additionally, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to further demonstrate the degradation of PET and PE films by the reconstituted bacterial community. We conducted transcriptomic methods to investigate the plastic degradation process and potential degradation mechanisms mediated by our reconstituted bacterial community. Lastly, we overexpressed PE degradation enzymes based on transcriptomic results and verified their significant degradation effects on the PE films. Overall, our study establishes a stable marine bacterial community that efficiently degrades PET and PE and provides insights into plastic degradation pathways and their associated biological and mechanistic processes—paving the way for developing microbial products against plastic wastes.',\n",

       " {'context': '               Following the oil industry, fashion manufacturing is the second largest polluting industry of the agricultural land leading to various unfavorable impacts on the environment. Sustainable fashion, also lightly known as eco-fashion, is a part of the rising design reality and trend. The aim is to build an approach that can bear the unlimited load of human impact on the environment and social obligation. Zero waste needs that human activity to only use nature’s assets at a rate that can be restored naturally. Hypothetically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the incapability to withstand human life. Such dilapidation on a comprehensive scale could entail extinction for the human race. Fashion is a complex business involving long and diverse supply chains of production, textile manufacture, raw material, garment construction, transportation, retail, consumption, and eventually disposal of clothes. The carbon footprint of this industry is tremendous. Obvious pollutants like pesticides that meet the common eye are used in producing natural fabrics. The hazardous dyes are used largely in manufacturing textiles discarding huge amounts of waste.               This chapter offers flexible approaches and easy-to-create zero-waste methods to help develop and create new designs out of discarded fashion. The chapter will include beautifully created illustrations converted into wearable outfits out of waste garments. This exercise of design research rejuvenates the method of eradicating fabric waste by utilizing zero waste pattern cutting to increase conceivable results. This conceptualization of new inventions created by the zero-waste concept may lead to the making of future aesthetics in production and economies. The “wealth from waste” is a new approach in the fashion frontier, developing new innovative sustainable textiles made from agricultural waste, plant fibers, including cactus, mushrooms, coconut, pineapple, banana, Aloe vera, and many more. Further, the life-cycle assessment and involvement of the waste management of fashion and textile industries in contributing the circular economy has also been focused.            ',\n",

Aside from mechanical and thermal recycling, thermochemical recycling can convert waste plastics to high-value products. Pyrolysis and gasification processes can convert waste plastics to liquid and gaseous streams that can be used for the synthesis of various products (the waste-refinery concept). Moreover, these same streams can be used to produce filamentous carbon nanomaterials (CNM), that is, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofilaments (CNF). Despite the significant progress made in the field of filamentous CNM synthesis, a full understanding of all aspects of the growth mechanism is still unavailable and, thus, there is no obvious structural control. Consequently, the first section of this article is dedicated to a general summary of CNM, including the current understanding of their growth mechanisms, the difference between the various types, and the conditions which control their growth. The second section aims to synthesize the data published in the scientific literature over the past decade on the production of filamentous CNM from the pyrolysis of waste plastics. The different reactor designs used to convert waste plastics to CNM are considered, and the effects of different parameters, including the catalyst used and process parameters, on the yield and quality of CNM from various types of waste plastics are discussed. Finally, applications for CNM are reviewed.',\n",

       " {'context': \"The most popular pavement material is asphalt concrete. As a result, experts have continued to be interested in improving the quality of asphalt concrete in order to improve its performance and longevity. Despite the fact that many other types of fibres and polymers have been used to strengthen asphalt concrete, fibres have gained a lot of attention due to their unique properties. As observed, the well-distributed fibres form a network in the composite's internal structure, resulting in tighter asphalt concrete. A method for mixing polypropylene, polyester, and waste denim fibres with bitumen was developed in this study, which resulted in uniform fibre dispersion. The current study looked into the effects of using synthetic fibres as a bituminous concrete ingredient, such as polypropylene, polyester, and scrap denim. Traditional bitumen and fibre modified binder are the subjects of a research project. The Optimum Binder Content (OBC) and Optimum Fiber Content (OFC) are calculated using the Marshall Procedure. Preparing asphalt concrete mixtures with the required fibre dosages ranging from 5 to 15% by weight of binder enables for extensive laboratory testing. The volumetric parameters of the mixes, as well as strength tests such marshall stability, are determined.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Catalytic cracking of plastics waste to produce fuel is increasingly gaining the attention of researchers worldwide. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on composition of liquid products from catalytic cracking of LDPE dissolved in benzene. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed. The catalytic cracking produced C1C8 hydrocarbons in all runs due to the effective heat exchange between polymer chains and catalysts. Analysis of products composition indicated that catalytic cracking of LDPE generally produced high amount of aliphatic branched-chain compounds, together with moderate amount of cyclic compounds. The reaction conditions also led to alkylation of benzene by the cracking products from LDPE. Hence, it is concluded that the catalytic cracking of LDPE is dominated by free radical mechanism, while the influence of carbenium ion is less pronounced due to low acidity of the catalyst. Overall, it is shown that catalytic cracking of LDPE solution in fixed bed reactor produced higher polymer conversion and liquid yield than conventional reactors and has the potential to extract hydrocarbon energy from recycled polymer waste.',\n",

Waste articles containing concentrations exceeding the LPCL values require special treatment to remove POP-BFRs before they can be recycled. Waste articles exceeding LPCLs in our study consist primarily of expanded polystyrene used as building insulation (44%), waste furniture foams and fabrics (41%), with waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) accounting for 13% and end of life vehicle waste contributing 1.7%. The recent listing of Deca-BDE under the Stockholm Convention means that a similar LPCL for its principal congener (BDE-209) is likely. Our data show that enforcement of an LPCL of 1000\\u202fmg/kg for BDE-209 would result in a further 1650\\u202ft/year of waste articles requiring special treatment. Our data show there to be 17,125\\u202fkg of POP-BFRs associated with waste polymers generated annually in Ireland. Enforcement of current LPCL values would prevent approximately 98% of these POP-BFRs from entering recycled goods.

In the present paper, antibacterial activity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles coated on low density poly ethylene films was evaluated against Escherichia coli as the representative organism. Silver nanoparticles were biosynthesized using banana peel extract as the reducing agent and characterized by means of UV–Visible spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses. Formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by the Surface Plasmon Resonance spectrum with absorption maxima at 431 nm. Particles were seen to be highly polydispersed with the average size in the range of 50–390 nm. Presence of elemental silver was confirmed by the Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli in the agar well diffusion test, with the zone of inhibition diameter measuring 19 mm. The silver nanoparticle coated low density poly ethylene film was prepared successfully and our antimicrobial studies revealed that the coated films declined the growth profile of bacteria starting from the log phase. Hence biosynthesized silver nanoparticles incorporated low density poly ethylene films can be suggested as an active packaging material for food packaging after further characterization and migration studies.',\n",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Solid carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CNMR)), silicon-29 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Si NMR)), and X-ray diffraction spectroscope ((XRD) were applied to characterize the hydrogel composite. The hydrogel composite was then employed as an adsorbent for the removal of Pb(II) from the aqueous solution. The Pb(II)-loaded hydrogel composite was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ((XPS)). From XPS results, it was found that the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the hydrogel composite participated in the removal of Pb(II). Kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption of Pb(II) followed the pseudo-second-order equation. It was also found that the Langmuir model described the adsorption isotherm better than the Freundlich isotherm. The maximum removal capacity of the hydrogel composite for Pb(II) ions was 430mg/g. Thus, the waste linear low-density polyethylene-g-poly (acrylic acid)-co-starch/organo-montmorillonite hydrogel composite could be a promising Pb(II) adsorbent.',\n",

Four different sources of aggregate based on petrography of rock were selected to ascertain the effect of different minerals on moisture damage. Qualitative as well as quantitative tests were utilized to assess moisture sensitivity. The analysis of test data showed that high density polyethylene and wet method of mixing has relatively better adhesion properties.

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis is considered as a promising technology to recover valuable hydrocarbons from waste streams. Even though some studies exist on waste plastics pyrolysis, it still lacks of in-depth knowledge on multiple components plastics pyrolysis. This study explores three types of waste plastics and their mixed forms to obtain thermal cracking features, products distribution, and kinetic features. TG-FTIR was used to observe the decomposition characteristics and functional groups in the volatile fractions of products. The interaction effects of the plastics components during the co-pyrolysis process were compared, analyzed, and reported. For a more precise knowledge of the reaction procedure, a thermodynamic study was conducted. Results showed that TG and DTG curves of PS and PE were similar to each other but different from those of PVC. The main products of PE and PS pyrolysis were alkanes and alkenes, while the major products of PVC pyrolysis were HCl, alkenes, and a small number of aromatic compounds. During the co-pyrolysis process of PS with PVC and PE with PVC, the thermal decomposition rates of PVC were accelerated due to synergistic effect. Implied by the kinetic parameters, pyrolysis of PS, PE, and PVC exhibited one-order reaction from pure component to multiple component mixtures.',\n",

Emphasis is placed on the influence of controlled copolymer structures and glycidyl methacrylate content on physical properties, thermal properties and rheological behavior of recycled PET. RAFT-synthesized reactive copolymers turned out to be very effective chain extenders leading to an increase in the molar mass intrinsic viscosity and diminished melt flow, indicating better melt elasticity and processability of R-PET. Tensile and impact analysis showed that functional GMA blocks reacted with PET end groups, causing a dramatic increase in the elongation-at-break and significant improvement of impact and tensile strength. Complex viscosity and rheological moduli of R-PET also increase greatly, indicating that flexibility of modified R-PET is improved. The van Gurp–Palmen plot of chain-extended R-PET confirms the increase in melt elasticity.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The use of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in the production of new concrete can provide several environmental benefits and reduce the pressure on natural resources. Due to the differences in the properties of RCA and natural aggregate, the properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) (i.e., concrete containing RCA) are different from those of normal concrete. Compressive strength (CS) of the RAC, which is a key parameter in many design codes, can be determined either through expensive and time-taking laboratory-based procedures or using empirical relationships. In this study, two types of hybridized machine learning algorithms (i.e., type-1 fuzzy inference system (T1FIS) and interval type-2fuzzy inference system (IT2FIS)) were used to develop predictive models for the CS of RAC. Moreover, arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), as a novel optimization algorithm, was employed to optimize the parameters of FIS models. To develop the CS predictive models, a dataset containing information on 1868 data records was used. The results indicate that the IT2FIS model outperformed the T1FIS model. A comparison of the results of this study with those reported in previous studies also confirms the high accuracy of the IT2FIS model. The findings indicate that concrete age, natural fine aggregate to total natural aggregate ratio, and superplasticizer to binder ratio have positive impacts on the CS, while the remaining input variables have negative influences on the CS. Regarding the intensities of the variables, concrete age, total coarse aggregate to cement ratio, and water to binder ratio are in the first to third orders, respectively.',\n",

Thermodynamic simulation was performed, and the effect of input power, PET feed rate and working gas flow rate on PET pyrolysis was experimentally investigated. An almost complete carbon conversion could be achieved by this method with a product gas containing 42% acetylene, 53% carbon monoxide and 4% ethylene, while the specific energy consumption of product gas was below 20\\u202fkWh/kg.

       " {'context': 'For developing a novel technology to reuse plastic waste chemically, the degradation of low-density polyethylene into aromatic hydrocarbons was investigated with H-gallosilicate as a catalyst at 375–550°C. The gallosilicate produced valuable aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX). The BTX yield increased with reaction temperature and went up to over 58wt.% at 500°C. The liquid products obtained at temperatures above 500°C consisted of aromatics only. For this simplified liquid composition and the high BTX yield, the catalytic degradation of polyethylene using H-gallosilicate is highly promising as a new technology for chemical recycling of polyolefins. The polyethylene degradation occurring at temperatures below 450°C involved aromatization by direct cyclization of the decomposed fragments that correspond to the liquid products with six or more carbon atoms. In addition to this, above that temperature, the aromatization also proceeded through the oligomerization of the C4 and C5 fractions formed in the degradation steps and subsequent cyclization. The latter mechanism contributed more to the formation of aromatics with increasing reaction temperature.',\n",

Using in-situ synthesized cellulose nanofibers we could successfully fabricate porous membranes which is not possible for bare PET matrix using water as nonsolvent. Thus, we could successfully replace methanol which was used as a suitable non-solvent in earlier reports by distilled water. We successfully used the membrane for separation of synthetic crude oil-water emulsion. The membrane showed permeability up to 98 Lm−2h−1 applying pressure of 1.5 bar. The membrane also achieved removal of more than 97 % of organic substances from a crude oil-water emulsion system. The optimum membrane also showed good thermal stability with initial degradation temperature ∼350 °C and tensile strength of 0.86 MPa.

However, the WCP-mortar related studies are centered on the material characterization and the performance of the mortars. For sustainability purposes, the mortars should provide the required strength as well as the economic and environmental benefits. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the properties of cement masonry mortar containing WCP, along with their economic and environmental advantages. In the experimental study, mortars were prepared by replacing ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with WCP in various fractions of 0%, 15%, 30%, 40%, 60%, 75%, and 100% by mass. The influence of WCP on the fresh and hardened properties of the mortars was examined. It was found that the strengths of the masonry mortars were reduced significantly as the quantity of WCP increased, yet mortar mixtures containing 40–75% WCP met the strength criteria for masonry mortar. Also, using WCP resulted in tremendous reductions in the cost and environmental factors of the mortars. In conclusion, the mortars provided the specified strength requirement for masonry work as well as economic and environmental gains, making them sustainable.',\n",

Effects of reprocessing were evaluated by the tensile testing and impact testing besides SEM, DSC, XRD and MFI rheological and characterization analysis. Test results of composite plates were compared with the pure low density polyethylene (LDPE) plate. Test results show that the tensile strength was increased till the 4th reprocessing step while reducing impact properties.

       " {'context': 'Future limitations on the availability of selected resources stress the need for increased material efficiency. In addition, in a climate-constrained world the impact of resource use on greenhouse gas emissions should be minimized. Waste management is key to achieve sustainable resource management. Ways to use resources more efficiently include prevention of waste, reuse of products and materials, and recycling of materials, while incineration and anaerobic digestion may recover part of the embodied energy of materials. This study used iWaste, a simulation model, to investigate the extent to which savings in energy consumption and CO2 emissions can be achieved in the Netherlands through recycling of waste streams versus waste incineration, and to assess the extent to which this potential is reflected in the LAP2 (currently initiated policy). Three waste streams (i.e. household waste, bulky household waste, and construction and demolition waste) and three scenarios compare current policy to scenarios that focus on high-quality recycling (Recycling+) or incineration with increased efficiency (Incineration+). The results show that aiming for more and high-quality recycling can result in emission reductions of 2.3MtCO2 annually in the Netherlands compared to the reference situation in 2008. The main contributors to this reduction potential are found in optimizing the recycling of plastics (PET, PE and PP), textiles, paper, and organic waste. A scenario assuming a higher energy conversion efficiency of the incinerator treating the residual waste stream, achieves an emission reduction equivalent to only one third (0.7MtCO2/year) of the reduction achieved in the Recycling+ scenario. Furthermore, the results of the study show that currently initiated policy only partially realizes the full potential identified. A focus on highest quality use of recovered materials is essential to realize the full potential energy and CO2 emission reduction identified for the Netherlands. Detailed economic and technical analyses of high quality recycling are recommended to further evaluate viable integrated waste management policies.',\n",

This contribution presents a systematic way to generate a list of potential waste-to-resource technologies based on the use of a semi-automatic ontological frameworks. The ontology is instantiated, giving the possibility to generate and assess a list of transformation processes alternatives, according to the potentially available waste streams and resource requirements in a specific area and/or sector. The resulting list is then analyzed and classified according to pre-established parameters, thus presenting which are the potentially best alternatives to close the material loops and recover chemical resources from available waste. The capabilities of the method to identify promising transformation technologies are assessed through an illustrative case study: the evaluation of different routes for the treatment of plastic waste materials, with the focus on chemical recycling.

       " {'context': 'The global presence of plastic debris has become an indisputable environmental issue. While it is useful to recycle used plastic materials, contaminated plastics require a series of pretreatments prior to the process. Here, we offer a viable thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) platform to directly valorize fishing net waste (FNW). Prior to the pyrolysis of FNW that was collected at a Korean seaport, its chemical composition (polyethylene) was examined using thermogravimetric analysis, ultimate analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pyrolysis of FNW was conducted to produce value-added syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) in both CO2 and N2 environments with a variety of pyrolysis setups. The pyrolysis temperature significantly contributed to the thermal cracking of long-chain liquid HCs into H2 and C1-2 HCs under the N2 and CO2 conditions. In the presence of cobalt-based catalysts, an additional improvement of the reaction kinetics for producing H2 and C1-2 HCs was shown in the N2 environment. However, the synergistic effectiveness of Co-based catalysts and CO2 resulted in CO formation, because CO2 provided additional C and O sources over the Co-based catalysts. Thus, it allowed control of the H2/CO ratio in the CO2 and N2 atmospheres. The compositional matrix of the liquid HCs after pyrolysis also confirmed that CO2 controlled their aromaticity. Thus, the CO2-cofeeding pyrolysis of FNW can be considered a viable platform for the direct treatment of plastic wastes by harvesting energy as a form of syngas.',\n",

Like glass bottles and metal-cans, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles also consume additional space in landfill in terms of volume and do not disintegrate for at least 100 years. Some architects and environmentalists have used PET bottles as eco-friendly brick showcasing its compressive strength and potentials, higher than traditional brick and reducing the overall construction cost compared to brick masonry. The aim of the research is to investigate the feasibility of using PET bottles as an alternative construction practice for the dwelling units of the urban poor as an “innovative method of construction of low-cost dwelling”. It also analyses the various central and state government schemes and discusses about the participatory roles played by each sector for proposed method of construction. The primary study comprising of data collection through questionnaire was conducted in Bhubaneswar City, a metropolitan area considered under Smart City scheme. The findings from the study shows that at least 8000 dwelling units of 37 m2 of carpet area can be built using PET bottles for exterior wall and partitions.

The feasibility of using cleaner production (CP) strategies to reduce CO2 was evaluated. For this purpose, a CP audit was conducted to quantitatively identify major entities that contributed to CO2 inside the boundary of the plant. The result showed that the plant generated 0.84 kg CO2/kg resins produced, which contributing to 1.9 million tons of overall annual CO2 generated from Malaysian plastic industry. In detail, 73.8% of the emission generated in the studied plant was contributed by electricity consumption, followed by solid waste generation (23.3%) and diesel consumption (2.3%). The value is lower than a virgin plastic resins producing plant, which has a CO2 value of 2 kg CO2/kg resins produced. After the audit, a total of four potential CP options were generated focusing on reducing energy consumption. Implementation of these options was expected to reduce CO2 generated from energy consumption by 0.11 kg CO2/kg resins produced, a reduction of about 18%.

Thus, one purpose of this research is to provide experimental results for FRAC characterizing damage growth and residual strain during cyclic compression in low-cycle tests with increasing strain amplitudes. Another purpose is to present a constitutive model to predict this behavior of FRAC accounting for fiber content. It is worth noting that the present results are relevant to displacement-controlled tests. The development law of residual strain (permanent strain) is explored, and the relationships between residual strain and unloading strain/reloading strain are proposed. The unloading stress-strain/reloading stress-strain equations are given. The damage evolution law of FRAC is revealed. Also, a new damage model represented by residual strain is suggested accounting for the fiber content. Furthermore, a stress-strain constitutive model coupling damage for FRAC is proposed.

       " {'context': 'Plastics are used in a wide range of applications generating significant waste streams. This is driving policy interventions to increase circularity, reduce waste and improve resource efficiency. However, information on plastic waste flows is not widely available across regions and nations. With an overarching aim to make recommendations for supporting the transition to a circular plastics economy in Northern Ireland, this study used quantitative uncertainties to conduct regional material flow analysis and geospatial mapping to identify local hotspots. It was observed that 149 ± 11 kilo tonnes of plastic waste were produced in Northern Ireland (79.2 kg/capita) in 2018. Reuse and recovery for recycling reached up to 35%, while 62% of plastic waste was landfilled with the remainder (3%) incinerated. This study found that there are increasing amounts of plastic waste locked in sectors with long product lifetimes, such as the construction sector with 21.3 kilo tonnes for 2018. It is therefore important to consider the processing capacities and environmental impacts of plastic waste management, not only for current plastic waste flows but also for tackling possible future growth of these flows. The results indicate that there is a need for a holistic all-island approach for effective plastic waste management in both Northern Ireland and the neighbouring Republic of Ireland. Furthermore, stricter enforcement of existing waste management rules and regulations could prevent need for additional policies to support a circular economy. This research provides robust scientific data to aid the transition to a circular economy for plastics in the region.',\n",

The key waste-to-energy technologies discussed in this review include conventional thermal incineration and the modern hydrothermal incineration. The thermochemical treatments (e.g. pyrolysis, liquefaction and gasification) and biological treatments (e.g. anaerobic digestion and composting) are also elaborated for the transformation of solid wastes to biofuel products. The current status of municipal solid waste management for effective disposal and diversion along with the opportunities and challenges has been comprehensively reviewed. The merits and technical challenges of the waste-to-energy technologies are systematically discussed to promote the diversion of solid wastes from landfill disposal to biorefineries.',\n",

Plastics are one option for improving the hydrogen to carbon efficiency ratio (H/Ceff) of biomass feedstock. Waste from agroindustry in blends with biomass could modify the reaction mechanism for removing oxygen by substituting decarbonylation and decarboxylation with dehydration. Firstly, fast pyrolysis was performed to find the optimal mass blending ratio for olive pomace (OP) and agroindustrial polymers (polyethylene (PE), polystyrenes (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) according to hydrocarbon production. Experimental results for the 1.5:1 OP/PE, 1:1.5 OP/PS and 1:1.5 OP/PVC mass blending ratios at 500 °C, showed synergistic enhancement of hydrocarbon yields. Alkenes yield were enhanced for 1.5:1 OP/PE, where the light hydrocarbons fraction (C6-C10) first increased and then decreased with temperature, reaching a maximum at 650 °C. For 1:1.5 OP/PS and 1:1.5 OP/PVC, it was improved the aromatic compounds formation, being 500 °C and 650 °C the optimal reaction temperature for the former and the later, respectively. Benzene, toluene and xylene were in large quantities obtained for PS and PVC blends with OP. Additionally, the synergistic effect on pyrolysis of the blends did not show any clear trend for pyrolytic gas emissions. In general, as reaction temperature increased, CO and CO2 emissions fell and CH4 was enhanced. Finally, olefin and aromatic yields were promoted for blends with a higher H/Ceff.',\n",

Therefore, in the present study, simultaneous effect of pomegranate waste (PW) and graphene oxide (GO) has been studied to improve the cellulase production along with improved stability towards the incubation temperature and different pH environment. Crude cellulase production has been achieved at high substrate concentration of PW using co-culturing of strains Cladosporium cladosporioides NS2 and Rhizopus oryzae NS5 under the solid-state fermentation (SSF) while using GO as the nanocatalyst. At a substrate concentration of 7.0 g of PW, highest enzymatic activity of 42 IU/gds FP, 271 IU/gds EG and 422 IU/gds BGL have been achieved by mean of 1.5% GO after 72 h. In addition, crude enzyme exhibits 45–55 °C and 3.5–6.5 as the most favorable incubation temperature and pH range, respectively in presence of 1.5% GO. This study reports a potential strategy to improve the production of crude enzyme along with enhanced thermal and pH stability with the implementation of GO as a nanocatalyst. Thus, the present approach offers a sustainable way to produce crude enzyme that can have numerous industrial applications along with economic biomass to biofuels production technology by providing easy, as well as high yield of sugar production via enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass.

       " {'context': \"Despite the benefits of reducing virgin plastic polymers in food packaging, the spread of reusable systems is limited by organizational and economic constraints, and reasonable doubts about their real environmental impacts still persist. Several studies have evaluated the environmental sustainability of reusable plastic containers (RPCs) compared to single-use systems; however, the trade-offs and benefits of reuse are not always clear. To model real-world network complexity with its bottlenecks and unbalanced infrastructural networks, primary data on traveled distances and flows collected throughout the logistics network must be included in the analysis. The material-driven characterization of the secondary package's logistic networks justifies the integration of Geographic Information Systems into LCA to overcome the limitations of using only secondary data, which is commonly done. This study evaluated alternative secondary packaging systems (SPSs) and associated material-driven networks using a spatial Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) approach augmented with a supply chain digital twin. The material-driven network flows were virtualized, and the resulting data on transportation emissions and fuel consumption represent the LCA input. The networks serve a countrywide Food Supply Chain (FSC) from growers to retailers, with up to 1600 nodes located in Italy over a 10-year time span. In this study, the Life Cycle Environmental Impact (LCEI) of nine alternative SPSs differing in size and material-driven network, that is, reusable polypropylene (PP) crates, single-use corrugated cardboard boxes (CCBs), and single-use PP crates, were investigated. The novel contributions of the study lie in the method, scale of analysis, and accuracy of spatial data collection. The results show that the higher transportation emissions of RPCs (+23.80% compared with that of CCBs) are balanced by the reduced production and disposal impacts per use. After 10 years, the environmental impacts of the single-use SPSs are higher than those of the RPC SPSs in all the impact categories evaluated. Considering GWP20, the RPCs are environmentally friendly after only 15 rotations. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of LCA results to transport parameters and highlights the importance of adopting supply chain digital twins to enhance the accuracy of the environmental profile of such complex logistic ecosystems.\",\n",

This chapter deals with the possible generation and management of hazardous waste and forecasts potential problems and solutions, with a special focus on Industry 4.0.            \",\n",

       " {'context': 'An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) of the management of 1ton of household waste was conducted in accordance with ISO 14044:2006 and the ILCD Handbook for seven European countries, namely Germany, Denmark, France, UK, Italy, Poland and Greece, representing different household waste compositions, waste management practices, technologies, and energy systems. National data were collected from a range of sources regarding household waste composition, household sorting efficiency, collection, waste treatments, recycling, electricity and heat composition, and technological efficiencies. The objective was to quantify the environmental performance in the different countries, in order to analyze the sources of the main environmental impacts and national differences which affect the results. In most of the seven countries, household waste management provides environmental benefits when considering the benefits of recycling of materials and recovering and utilization of energy. Environmental benefits come from paper recycling and, to a lesser extent, the recycling of metals and glass. Waste-to-energy plants can lead to an environmental load (as in France) or a saving (Germany and Denmark), depending mainly on the composition of the energy being substituted. Sensitivity analysis and a data quality assessment identified a range of critical parameters, suggesting from where better data should be obtained. The study concluded that household waste management is environmentally the best in European countries with a minimum reliance on landfilling, also induced by the implementation of the Waste Hierarchy, though environmental performance does not correlate clearly with the rate of material recycling. From an environmental point of view, this calls for a change in the waste management paradigm, with less focus on where the waste is routed and more of a focus on the quality and utilization of recovered materials and energy.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Carbon capture technologies have been extensively investigated as indispensable tools for reducing CO2 emissions. In particular, CO2 capture using solid waste-derived porous carbons (SWDPCs) has attracted significant research attention as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches to simultaneously mitigate climate change and address solid waste management challenges. Considerable research has recently been conducted on the thermal and chemical treatments of solid waste for upcycling into porous carbons (PCs) for effective and selective CO2 capture. In this review, we discuss the synergistic benefits of employing SWDPCs for CO2 capture and introduce innovative approaches for converting solid waste into PCs with the desired physical and chemical properties. The performance of SWDPCs for CO2 capture is comprehensively discussed in terms of the synthesis route, CO2 capture capacity, process cyclability, and sample optimization guided by machine learning. Furthermore, the mechanisms of CO2 capture on PCs are discussed based on pore structures and incorporated surface functional groups. The life-cycle environmental impact of the PCs synthesized from solid waste and their practical applications for CO2 capture are also evaluated. The overall environmental benefits of the proposed SWDPC-based CO2 capture approach are analyzed in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the remaining challenges in upcycling solid waste into high-performance CO2 adsorbents are discussed, and potential solutions are proposed.',\n",

A substantial solid reduction was observed for the wastes through the wet oxidation deconstruction process, which breaks down the physical structure of the waste materials and segregates the solids into useable process outputs, such as acetic acid. At 280\\u202f°C, more than 90% of total suspended solids were successfully reduced and at least 1500\\u202fmg/L of acetic acid was produced for each individual material. The mixture of materials representing a non-recyclable municipal solid waste stream produced approximately 2930\\u202fmg/L of acetic acid.

Fifteen mixtures were produced including different percentages by weight of plastic aggregate with two different granulometries. In each case, the strength properties (flexural and compressive) and density of the new composites were tested. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) were performed in order to know the internal structure and porosity of the new composites. Finally, a simplified environmental study was conducted using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The results show that lighter and more eco-efficient materials can be obtained that have, in some cases, better mechanical properties than the reference material (gypsum). A density reduction of a 9.89% was achieved for mixtures with 60% of plastic waste, having also an environmental improvement of 35% compared to the reference sample. In all the cases, the minimum values for mechanical properties required by the standard were obtained. These properties make the composites suitable for use in new products and in construction works.',\n",

A positive interaction caused by the co-pyrolysis of SS and LDPE has been confirmed by the improved weight loss rate and devolatilization. Discrepancies between theoretical and experimental TGA/DTG curves as a measurement of the extent of synergic effect proved the existence of chemical interactions during the co-pyrolysis between the SS and LDPE blends of 1:1 and 1:2 ratios. The activation energy and reaction order for raw materials and their blends were studied by Coats-Redfern model. SS and LDPE blend of 1:1 ratio was optimal as it decreased the activation energy. Meanwhile, kinetics and thermodynamics were obtained from Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Starink methods. Where the activation energies (76.73–355.83 kJ/mol), Gibbs free energy (116.92–123.04 kJ/mol) and lower difference of enthalpy (ΔH=∼6 kJ/mol) showed a promising potential to convert abundant and low-cost bio-solid wastes into bioenergy.

       " {'context': 'The quantity of organic solid waste (OSW) discharged by the public has increased significantly in recent years. Herein, we consider bio-waste and plastic waste. Bio-waste, also known as biomass, is a sustainable and abundant energy source available in diverse forms. Plastic waste is a cheap hydrogen source contained within OSW. The transformation of OSW via pyrolysis involves the thermochemical conversion of biomass and plastic. This conversion can mitigate waste accumulation issues and lead to synergistic product improvements for fuels and chemicals. This paper reviews the occurrence and extent of the synergistic/interactive effect during the co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and biomass. The influence of various factors, including the plastic type, biomass type, mixing ratio, reactor type, heating rate, reaction temperature, and catalysts, on the synergistic effect is considered. Furthermore, reasonable interaction mechanisms related to the synergistic effect during co-pyrolysis are presented. The outcome of this review revealed that the interaction mechanisms by which the synergistic effect may occur are the transfer of active hydrogen radicals from plastic to the biomass unstable oxygenated radicals, the catalytic activity of the alkali/alkaline earth metal species in biomass, and the heat and mass transfer during the co-conversion. Biomass pre-treatment, the use of catalysts, and the similarity between the chemical structure of the biomass and the plastic used can strengthen the interactions. Synergistic effects are likely to occur to a great extent at a low heating rate at high temperatures. The conclusions regarding the blend ratio are inconclusive.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The number of manufactured aircraft has been continuously increasing worldwide because of the high demand for airline transportation. During manufacturing, many advanced materials and devices are used to build various sizes and shapes of aircraft. However, most of these materials and devices require considerable energy and labor to produce, so reusing these at any life stage of the aircraft offers many economic and environmental benefits, and is considered lucrative and environmentally responsible. Several recyclable materials—composites, metals and alloys, wires, wood, paper, plastics, electronics, and avionics—emerge as waste streams during the manufacturing of aircraft. Many aircraft companies have been recycling these materials to remanufacture aircraft parts or other products for more sustainable production. In the present study, we evaluated the recycling efforts of local aircraft companies in Wichita, KS. These efforts were considered in terms of recycling efficiency/rate and environmental benefits. These included cradle-to-gate (CTG) life-cycle inventory analysis of the materials, carbon dioxide emissions, virgin material replacement with recycled materials, and natural resources usage. Our findings show that there exists a significant potential for contributions to sustainability as well as environmental and health benefits in the region from recycling by aircraft manufacturing plants.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) has the potential to escape the predicament of our cities being surrounded by construction waste, while its application is limited due to the defective mechanical properties. This paper aims to improve the performance behavior of RAC, thereby extending its engineering application. A new-style green RAC is prepared by recycled aggregate, steel fiber and sulphoaluminate cement, as infilling into steel tube to manufacture CFST columns. A comprehensive study for 41 concrete mixes and 54 CFST columns subjected to bending is presented. The parameters are steel fiber volume content, recycled aggregate dosage, water cement ratio, cement type and steel tube thickness. The test result reveals that, through reasonable mix design, steel fiber reinforced self-stressing recycled aggregate concrete-filled steel tube can exhibit similar flexural behavior with the normal CFST. Steel fibers prolong the elastic extent and improve the flexural capacity, meanwhile 1.2% of steel fiber is recommended for the optimal improvement. Self-stress induced by the expansive sulphoaluminate cement contributes to the elastic stage, and is beneficial to flexural capacity and stiffness.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Continuous generation of plastic waste has prompted substantial research efforts in its utilization as a feedstock for energy generation. Pyrolysis has emerged as one of the best waste management technique for energy extraction from the plastic waste. The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of operating temperature on the liquid product yields in the pyrolysis process by non-isothermal heating. Non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) [high density polyethylene (HDPE)], waste polypropene (PP), waste polystyrene (PS), waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and mixed plastic waste (MPW) was carried out in a non-sweeping atmosphere in a semi-batch reactor at four different temperatures 450, 500, 550, and 600\\u202f°C. The minimum degradation temperature of the mixed and individual plastics was obtained using a thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA) at a heating rate of 20\\u202f°C/min. The TGA results show that all plastics degrade in a single step and the degradation temperatures of PS\\u202f>\\u202fPET\\u202f>\\u202fPP\\u202f>\\u202fHDPE, while mixed plastic degradation indicates two distinct degradation steps. Further, a waste polymer shows a lower degradation temperature than the virgin polymer. The degradation of HDPE is found to produce the maximum oil yield with minimum solid residue. The degradation of PET results in the highest amount of solid and benzoic acid as crystals and gas with no oil. Degradation of mixed plastic causes oil yield in the intermediate range of pyrolysis of individual plastic wastes. Overall, 500\\u202f°C is observed to be an optimum temperature for the recovery of low-density pyrolytic oil with the highest liquid yield. The degradation of PE and PP is found to be caused by random chain scission followed by inter and intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The degradation of PS occurs by side elimination or end chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The degradation of mix plastics results from random chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The effect of temperature on oil and gas recovery as well as recovery time was also assessed.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A mathematical model based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) results is developed to assess the environmental efficiency of the end-of-life management of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. For this purpose, multiobjective optimization and decision support tools are used to define optimal targets for efficient waste management. The global environmental impacts associated with the treatment of PET bottles from their cradle to their ultimate graves (incineration, landfill, recycling by mechanical, chemical or thermal processes) are computed in function of the flow of bottles in the different valorization paths. They are based on the calculation of the impacts involved in each elementary process with a LCA software tool, using the CML impact assessment method. The model takes into account the fraction λ of PET regenerated into bottles that can be further recycled, the global impacts being the cumulative impacts corresponding to each “end-of-life”. A nonlinear model for the bottle waste collection stage is considered, reflecting that the more diffuse the flow of bottles is, the more difficult it is to collect and consequently, the more environmentally impacting. The resulting multiobjective problem is to find the allocation of bottles between valorization paths that minimizes the environmental impacts of bottle end-of-lives. It is solved using a genetic algorithm, and the trade-off between environmental impacts is illustrated through Pareto curves. A decision support tool then determines the best compromise among the set of solutions. The model is applied to the case of France in 2010. The variables that minimize simultaneously abiotic depletion, acidification and global warming potential are determined, in particular the number of recycling loops. The approach can be easily adapted to any specific product like bio-based plastics or organic wastes to find the optimal allocation between valorization paths.',\n",

The enzymatic activity of the commercial preparation of α-glucosidase was 936.23 ± 0.71 U/mL. The Michaelis–Menten model was used to adjust the experimental data, and its kinetic parameters were used in the simulation. Maximum IMO production from a mixture of 18% plantain flour with a starch content of 84% was obtained for a reaction of 6 h in the transglycosylation step (29 ± 3 g/L isomaltotetraose and 8 ± 3 g/L isomaltopentaose). The best scenario to produce IMO showed a net present value of $ 459,000. Results suggest that IMO syrup production for a large scale, including an integrated production of single cell protein considering a batch size greater than 11,126 kg rejected fruits is feasible, if the production costs associated with labor are reduced and the selling price of the products increases according to the variation of the market. This work demonstrated that the rejected plantain pulp exhibits high potential as an ingredient to produce prebiotic compounds such as IMO.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of an integrated system that involves flexible packaging plastic waste (FPPW) pyrolysis, oil upgrading, and MWCNTs production. The objectives were to determine the environmental impact of MWCNTs synthesis from non-condensable pyrolysis gases, and to assess the environmental impact of MWCNTs synthesis from different plastic fractions. Integrating MWCNTs synthesis to the plastic pyrolysis process provides various environmental benefits including, reduction of contribution towards climate change, fossil depletion, human toxicity (cancer), and ionizing radiation potentials. Sensitivity analysis of MWCNTs yields provided the range of impacts on the environment and a critical yield of >2% for most impact categories was determined. Comparison of different plastic fractions indicated that using low PET content feedstock had lesser impact on the environment, and demonstrated comparable performance to mixed virgin plastics for most impact categories. The results highlighted the versatility of the integrated pyrolysis process for treating diverse plastic waste fractions with negligible effects from the impurities present in the actual FPPW during thermal processing.',\n",

This paper shows the flexural behavior of 15 FRĆs specimens with different aspect ratio and dosage of RF (shredded plastic PET bottles), to understand how these parameters affect their performance. In addition, 9 FRĆs samples with virgin fibers (commercial Polypropylene) and 2 control samples (without fibers) were used as comparative elements. Workability, three-point bending and residual pull-out tests in combination with a count of fibers in the cracking section were developed. The results show a better flexural behavior of FRC of samples with high dosage and aspect ratio of RF, this combination generated similar or superior flexural performance with a better adherence in the concrete than those with virgin fibers. Data showed three principal problems with FRĆs with RF, a reduction of the workability in comparison with concrete without fibers, a lower quantity of fiber than samples with virgin fibers, and a non-uniform tendency in their mechanical performance.',\n",

For this reason several plasters have been studied, in which virgin raw materials such as natural sand and limestone filler were replaced up to 100% by waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles and pulverized Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) waste, respectively. Moreover, an attempt was made to combine PET waste particles and wood waste (WW) particles in order to improve functional properties of plasters. As supplementary cementitious material silica fume was employed, which is a further industrial by-product obtained from silicon wafer sawing during the production process of solar panels. Finally, in some mixtures even cement was fully replaced by a combination of lime and hydraulic lime in order to further improve the carbon footprint of these plasters. At the end of the optimisation process, environmentally-friendly plasters have been obtained with 100% waste particles replacing virgin materials, which proved to be energy efficient thanks to the low thermal conductivity values achieved, as well as for their remarkable lightness.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis provides a sustainable solution for managing post-consumer mixed plastic waste (PC-MPW) streams by producing valuable mixtures of liquids and gases, which have potential for use as fuels. Compared with landfilling, gasification and incineration processes, pyrolysis has the smallest environmental footprint. Waxes produced as an intermediate product of controlled pyrolysis conditions have been used as viscosity-reducing additives in modified asphalts, which reduce energy requirements for heating and mixing on site. The chars produced from PC-MPW pyrolysis have been used to produce activated carbon (adsorbents), additives in epoxy resins and fuel briquettes. These chars have proven to increase the conductivity, thermal stability and non-flammability of epoxy resin composites. Furthermore, the chars also have potential as additives in concretes to reduce the carbon footprint associated with Portland cement production. Albeit PC-MPW-chars have not been used in civil engineering applications to date, chars derived from other organic sources (e.g. wood) have been successfully used in cement admixtures and demonstrated their atmospheric carbon sequestration and strength gaining capabilities. The material properties of the chars that are responsible for producing such promising performances include high porosity (which enables water absorption and retention capacities), high surface area and reactivity (particularly for chars produced at higher pyrolysis temperatures) for promoting the formation of cementitious gels. Furthermore, pulverised chars act as a “micro-filler” within cementitious materials, whereby they fill pore spaces and increase material strength and stiffness. This study highlights the promise of PC-MPW chars as a low carbon additive for use in cement-based construction materials.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study investigated the thermal performance of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system for low-temperature waste heat storage. Considering the large amount of low-temperature heat from industrial effluents wasted to the environment, this study intends to store this low-temperature waste heat in the ground. A GSHP system for low-temperature waste heat storage was established, which could simultaneously achieve heat storage and extraction. In this system, the borehole cluster comprises two parts: inner and outer layers of ground heat exchangers (GHEs). The inner layer was used for space heating as a common GHE, which extracts heat from the ground, whereas the outer layer connected to the industry was designed for injecting low-temperature waste heat to the ground seasonally. The heat fluxes of the GHEs for heat injection and extraction were set differently and were taken as two different strengths of heat sources in this study. A heat and moisture transfer model was established and experimentally validated. Subsequently, the waste heat storage and heat extraction processes are modelled numerically. The results show that the average soil temperature increases by at least 2.63 and 6% when the heat flux of the outer layer GHEs are 40 and 50 Km−1, respectively. It reveals that the injection of low temperature waste heat into the soil is not only beneficial to waste heat recovery, but can also alleviate soil thermal imbalance, providing significant support in heating dominated area, especially in cold regions. This study complements the thermal analysis between two different strength of heat sources, providing a reference for practical engineering design.',\n",

The results indicate that the inclusion of CR led to a 4.7%–26.7% improvement in workability of RSFRAM when the RTSF content was low, while the addition of RTSF compensated the strength loss caused by the addition of CR. The combination of CR and RTSF created a synergistic effect on the flexural behaviour of RSFRAM. The optimal mixture was regarded as R5F1.0 (5% CR replacement and 1.0\\u202fvol% RTSF) exhibiting comparable compressive strength, and superior flexural strength (around 171.1% higher), toughness indices (highest among all RSFRAMs) and residual strength factors (higher than 100) compared to the reference mixture without CR and RTSF. In addition, R5F1.0 can meet the strength requirement of concrete (i.e. 28\\u202fMPa for basic construction application) and thus suitable for structural applications as a sustainable material.',\n",

The properties of the fuel and its blends with commercial diesel have been estimated using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method. The properties of the fuel were as follows- density: 0.807 g/cm3, specific gravity: 0.781, °API gravity: 49.66, kinematic viscosity: 2.05 cst, aniline point: ∼59.8 °C, flash point: 51.3, fire points: 53.4 °C, cloud point: 9 °C, pour point: 5 ± 1 °C, calorific value: 48.69–52.93 MJ/Kg. In order to analyze the fuel-burning properties, the carbon residue was determined and it's found to be ∼0.75 wt% which is at par the commercial fuel. The results of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) revealed that the liquid products contain different hydrocarbons (viz., paraffin, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and lower hydrocarbons). According to the results of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), the percentage composition of pyro-oil was 11.13% aromatics (v/v), 21.08% olefins (v/v) and 67.79% paraffin's (v/v). Finally, the blending of pyro-oil has been tested for engine performance and found to be comparable with the commercially available fuels.\",\n",

Recycling of spent LIBs has attracted much attention because of the serious environmental pollution and high economic value. Although some established techniques have been presented in spent LIBs recycling process, but most of them focus on cathode material recycling due to its high economic value. Therefore, preparation of high purity cathode material by a proper pretreating technology is an important procedure. In this paper, the technologies used in the pretreating process of spent LIBs are summarized systematically from three main points of discharging procedure, liberation, and separation. The collaborative application of multi-technologies is the key to realize efficient pretreating process, which can lay the foundation for the subsequent metallurgical process. In addition, an alternative pretreating flowchart of spent LIBs is proposed based on the multi-process collaboration. Pretreating procedures in this process are mainly based on the physical property difference, and they include “Discharging-Shredding-Crushing-Sieving-Separation”.',\n",

In the past decades, due to the lack of proper economic and environmentally-benign recycling technologies, a major fraction of e-waste generated was either destined to landfills or incinerated with the sole intention of its disposal disregarding the toxic nature of this waste. Recently, with the increasing public awareness over their environment and health issues and with the enaction of more stringent regulations, environmentally-benign recycling has been driven to be an alternative option partially replacing the traditional eco-unfriendly disposal methods. One of the most favorable green technologies has been the mechanical separation of the metallic and nonmetallic fraction of the waste printed circuit boards. Although metallic fraction, as the most profitable component, is used to generate the revenue of the separation process, the nonmetallic fraction (NMF) has been left isolated.

       " {'context': 'A huge amount of waste halogenated plastics is a considerable resource pool but how to transform these wastes into functional products is always a great technical challenge due to potential release of halogenated dioxin during process. In this study, one type of benign reaction medium-sub/supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) was used for converting halogenated plastics into magnetic carbon-based hybrid along with simultaneous dehalogenation. It was found that Sc-CO2 treatment coupled with subsistent iron salt adjuvant advantageously inhibited the generation of benzene derivatives with high molecular weight and facilitated growth of pore structure of carbon skeleton with limited production of coke tars. Meanwhile, magnetic Fe3O4 particles were gradually crystallized and eventually encapsulated in ordered mesoporous carbonaceous product to enhance the further carbonization of plastics without any halide residues. Cr(Ⅵ) immobilization tests indicated that as-obtained magnetic hybrid exhibited great adsorption capacity above 157 mg g−1 and the immobilization process was well fit for Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. This study provides a new insight into a cost-effective process for fabrication of magnetic functional hybrid using waste halogenated plastics without release of second pollutants and its versatile application as adsorbents or catalysts.',\n",

The inherent inferior properties of recycled aggregate concrete weaken the bond performance with steel tubes. This study investigated several methods to enhance the bond behavior between recycled aggregate concrete and steel tubes, for instance adding steel fibers, adjusting the water-binder ratio, introducing expansive cement, and thickening the steel tube. A repeated push-out test for 36 specimens was also conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the undesirable impacts of recycled aggregate on the bond strength are offset by steel fibers and self-stress. Adding steel fibers simultaneously delays the decrease in bond strength during cycle loading. The benefit of self-stress relies on the steel tube thickness. The thicker steel tube is, the more remarkable the benefit becomes. Meanwhile, a predicted formulas is proposed, and gives the reasonable prediction of the bond strength between recycled aggregate concrete and steel tube.',\n",

The yields and morphologies of CNTs strongly depend on the catalyst design and reaction conditions. To boost the efficiency, tuning of bimetallic nanoparticles as catalyst is an effective approach. For that reason, A-site-deficient perovskite La0·8Ni1-xCoxO3-δ (LN1-xCx, x = 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) was developed and used as a catalyst precursor to achieve in situ formation of bimetallic Ni–Co nanoparticles. At an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio, the LN0.5C0.5 exhibited the highest yields of multi-walled CNTs, namely 840 and 853 mg/gcatalyst from high density polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. This could be attributed to the higher catalytic capability of LN0.5C0.5 catalyst for the decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon. In both cases, multi-walled CNTs had regular shapes when the reaction temperature was 700 °C. At higher reaction temperatures, the morphological changes of carbon products were observed from multi-walled CNTs to carbon nano-onions. The Raman spectra showed that compared with the commercial multi-walled CNTs, the as-prepared multi-walled CNTs had a lower degree of defects.',\n",

Hence, functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been used to fill those gabs and are commonly used for metallic adsorption in contaminated waters. High surface to volume ratio of those MNPs allows for a larger capacity of pollutant adsorption. In this study, functionalized iron oxide MNPs are synthesized by a novel green approach using plant phytochemicals with the capability of absorbing multiple organic pollutants. Herein, we studied synthesis of iron oxide MNPs with crude plant extracts using a simple maceration technique. The reaction was supported further by heat treatments at the supercritical condition of ethanol to complete the reduction process to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Our XRD result shows formation of spherical and cubic goethite (before treatment-Y0PL), magnetite (after treatment -Y0PR) and magnetite (after treatment and functionalization-Y0PRP) with an average crystalline size 277, 29, 45 nm respectively. Phytochemicals increased the size and altered texture of nanoparticles. The magnetic properties were measured for magnetization dependence on external magnetic field to show superparamagnetic behavior with Ms = 44 (Hc = 123 Oe), 36 (Hc = 133 Oe) and 13 (Hc = 44 Oe) emu/g for Y0PR, Y0PRP and Y0PL, respectively. Absorption/reduction efficiency of nanoparticles was studied against MB (10–140 mg/L) and 4-NA (0.5–1 mM). As synthesized green nanoparticles absorbed the model dyes above 80% efficiency under a wide range of conditions in a very short time and 94% under optimum conditions. Moreover, this work introduces successful alternative recyclability in particular for weakly magnetic nanoparticles by growing them on the surface of polyvinyl alcohol solid support. Therefore, the green synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles prepared in this study are easy to synthesize and cost-effective and enviro-friendly water treatment agents.',\n",

The recyclability index is defined as a measure of the ability of a material to regain its valued properties when subjected to a special recycling process. A method is proposed to determine the recyclability of a material during the design phase. This research method combines case-based reasoning (CBR) and the analytical hierarchy process to simplify the calculation of the recyclability index for a product. Designers can extract experiences from past cases to (1) calculate the recyclability rate of a designed product, (2) determine the possibility of recycling end-of-life (EOL) products, and (3) finalise a recycling plan for EOL products when including a new product in a recycling and treatment system.',\n",

However, the rheological properties of an AMWP–cement slurry are considerably affected by the unsaturated polyester in AMWP. This study aims to use fatty acid methyl ester polyoxyethylene ether (FMEE) as an admixture in AMWP–cement cementitious materials to improve the rheological properties of the AMWP–cement system. The fluidity, rheological properties, and mechanical properties of the AMWP–cement system to which different concentrations of FMEE were added were evaluated. Laser particle size analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were also conducted to identify the mechanism allowing AMWP to affect the rheological properties of the cement paste and determine the effect of FMEE on improving the rheological properties. Results indicate that the adsorption of polycarboxylate (PCE) superplasticizers on cement particles in the AMWP–cement system is heavily influenced by polyethylene terephthalate in AMWP. The addition of FMEE competes with the adsorption of PCE on AMWP. FMEE with a robust adsorption capacity is then preferentially adsorbed on AMWP, such that the PCE with no adsorption sites is adsorbed on cement particles, thus improving the rheological properties of the cement slurry. Meanwhile, the pores generated by FMEE and AMWP affect cement hydration, in addition to the formation and bonding of hydration products. These two factors reduce the mechanical properties of the cement mortar.',\n",

It concerns a recycling study of wood waste, polystyrene waste and plastic waste. The objective of this study is to upgrade wood waste and plastic wastes (low and high density polyethylene) and expanded polystyrene in waste disposal in the developing countries of Africa. Two types of wood particle composites based on plastic and polystyrene polymers have been developed. The physical properties (density, water absorption and volumetric swelling) and mechanical properties (modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture) required for their implementation are determined. The quantities found show that these composites can be used to produce self-adhesive sandwich panels or boards which will serve as a door core, false ceilings, formwork sandwich boards, interior and exterior flooring and furnishing materials.',\n",

The concrete composites were characterized in terms of compressive strength, post-cracking compressive strength, toughness indeces, thermal conductivity, density, and water absorptivity. Correlation tables were used to understand the key material parameter of PAG governing concrete properties. The effects of the replacement percentage, the PAG kind, the level of impurity, and the time-related variations on the quality of the concrete are discussed.

       " {'context': 'It is well known that reserves of non-renewable resources are limited and that waste emitted into the air, soil and earth pollute the environment. In addition to proposing a change in the architects’ way of thinking, the climate change further requires an improvement in the environment, politics and social consciousness. The chase for sustainable architecture must also consider the end of the life cycles of materials. The aim of this work is to introduce new concepts regarding materials and building elements that reach the end of their first life cycle and to evaluate the potential for recyclability of those materials. The research method is based on a hierarchic upside down pyramid that gives priority to the reuse and recycling of materials and afterwards allows for the creation of recyclability levels of the materials and elements. The results show that the concepts created regarding recycled, infracycled, reused and infraused materials are more suitable to the current situation. The indexes of recyclability quantify the betterment of the environment in the construction processes of buildings that are made from recycled or recyclable materials. In this manner, recyclability allows changing the way architects design and construct buildings, and it is a step forward to the closed-loop material cycle.',\n",

In this study we report the fabrication of cellulose ultrafiltration membranes and their application in recovery of propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) used as developer solvent in SU-8 photolithography. Cellulose membranes were fabricated via alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose acetate membranes in aqueous NaOH. Membrane permeance and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) were tuned via changing cellulose acetate concentration in precursor solution and evaporation of volatile co-solvent, acetone. MWCO of the membranes was found to be smallest in DMSO, followed by water and largest in methanol. The difference was attributed to the different hydrodynamic diameters of the probe molecules in these solvents. SU-8 rejection from its representative developer solutions in PGMEA was assessed in dead-end filtration at up to 80% permeate recovery. After the first filtration, the collected permeate was fed to the same membrane to simulate a two-stage filtration scenario. Rejection was in the range of 87%–89% in a first stage filtration and 79%–80% in a second stage, both operated at 80% permeate recovery. Recycled solvent could be used in photolithography although with some loss of pattern fidelity, possibly owing to remaining SU-8 and photoacid generator in PGMEA.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Pervious concrete (PC) has been widely used to construct concrete pavements and to increase the permeable surfaces all over the world. With the boost in the use of PC, it is necessary to make it more environmental-friendly and cost efficient. This study investigates employing recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and pozzolanic additives as a partial replacement (PR) of natural coarse aggregate (NCA) and Portland cement, respectively. For this purpose, the NCA was replaced with 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% RCA and the Portland cement was replaced with 10%, 25% and 50% pumice used in combination with 1–3% nano-clay (NC). The compressive and flexural strengths, void content, density, and permeability of concrete were evaluated. Moreover, the effect of adding three different types of fibers including steel fiber (STF), macro-fiber (MF), and waste plastic fiber (WPF) at volume fractions of 1% and 2% on the properties of concrete was studied. A total number of 7791 specimens from 371 mixtures were cast and tested. Using RCA decreased density, compressive strength (CS) (up to 58%) and flexural strength (FS) (up to 64%) and increased the void content and permeability (up to 15%) of concrete. The use of pumice generally reduced the early-age strength of concrete; however, using 10–25% pumice increased the mechanical strength at 90 days. Incorporating 1–3% NC also had positive effects on the strength properties and led to a minor reduction in permeability. STF performed better than MF and WPF, and adding 1% STF, MF, and WPF increased the 180-day FS of RC25 by 78.9%, 67.4% and 37.1%, respectively. The effectiveness of fibers declined with the increase in RCA content, which could be related to the poor compaction of concrete. According to the test results, the 90-day CS of mix RC50Pu25 with 2% STF and mix RC100Pu10NC1 was equal to the control mix. Therefore, it sounds that it is a feasible approach to significantly reduce the consumption of NCA and cement by using specific dosages of the other materials used in this study.',\n",

Accordingly, this work aims at eco-sustainable recycling concrete waste (CoW) and hazardous lead-bearing sludge (LBS) in the cleaner production of alkali-activated cementitious materials. The activation of powdered-CoW with different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) contents yields hardened materials, with modest compressive strengths, in which pirssonite is the dominant binding phase as confirmed by X-ray diffractogram, thermal analyses, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. These materials demonstrate low stability in humidity-rich-environment as a significant regression in their mechanical properties was recorded after 30-days of curing. The use of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) as alternative to NaOH represents two synergistic positive effects, which are working together, including the enhancement of mechanical properties and stability of the hardened materials at the long term of curing. The positive impact of Na2SiO3 is mainly originated from the formation silicate-rich strength-giving-phases with higher binding capacity and stability compared to pirssonite-phase. LBS was beneficially used as an alternative silicate source to avoid the negative impact of Na2SiO3 on environment. The incorporation of 10 wt % LBS in NaOH–CoW system has resulted in the creation of hardened material with mechanical properties superior to Na2SiO3–CoW one, notably long run stability. The high Pb-immobilization, stability, and acceptable compressive strength are the dominant parameters which directly reflect on the safe and benefit use of NaOH–CoW/LBS10 composite as building brick.',\n",

This is the first paper which describes the recycled polymer ternary blends of (1) recycled low density polyethylene (RLDPE), (2) recycled high density polyethylene (RHDPE) and (3) recycled polypropylene (RPP). The date palm fibre reinforced composites (CD00) were prepared by maintaining constant weight% of fibre of 20wt% without any fibre treatment. Maleic anhydride (MA) was used as the compatabilizer (1 and 2wt%) and the effect of compatabilizer on the blend matrix composites was studied. The mechanical, thermal, morphological properties, water absorption and chemical resistance properties were evaluated for these composites and also studied for pure blend matrix (C00). Date palm fibre improved the tensile strength and hardness of recycled polymer blend matrix. Further improvement was achieved with 1% MA (CD1), which showed that 1% MA treated composites (CD1) had higher tensile strength, modulus and hardness properties. Thermal stability and water absorption were improved by 1% MA. These improvements were demonstrated at the nanoscale level by the decrease in roughness appearing in Atomic Force Spectroscopic Microscopy analysis indicating that flow is better under this concentration. The SEM analysis also showed that the fibre matrix adhesion improved by adding 1wt% (CD1) of MA. The melting and crystallisation temperatures of the blends did not change with the addition of date palm fibre and MA, indicating that the additives did not influence the melting and crystallisation properties of the composites. The chemical resistance test results showed that these composites are resistance to all chemicals but more weight gain observed in solvents. 2wt% of MA (CD2) caused poor adhesion between the polymer chains and fibres as well as polymer chain scission.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Most of the integrated systems for municipal solid waste management aim to increase the recycling of secondary materials by means of physical processes including sorting, shredding and reprocessing. Several restrictions prevent from reaching a very high material recycling efficiency: the variability of the composition of new-marketed materials used for packaging production and its shape and complexity are critical issues. The packaging goods are in fact made of different materials (aluminium, polymers, paper, etc.), possibly assembled, having different shape (flat, cylindrical, one-dimensional, etc.), density, colours, optical properties and so on. These aspects limit the effectiveness and efficiency of the sorting and reprocessing plants. The scope of this study was to evaluate the performance of a large scale Material Recovery Facility (MRF) by utilizing data collected during a long period of monitoring. The database resulted from the measured data has been organized in four sections: (1) data related to the amount and type of inlet waste; (2) amount and composition of output products and waste; (3) operating data (such as worked hours for shift, planned and unscheduled maintenance time, setting parameters of the equipment, and energy consumption for shift); (4) economic data (value of each product, disposal price for the produced waste, penalty for non-compliance of products and waste, etc.). A part of this database has been utilized to build an executive dashboard composed by a set of performance indicators suitable to measure the effectiveness and the efficiency of the MRF operations. The dashboard revealed itself as a powerful tool to support managers and engineers in their decisions in respect to the market demand or compliance regulation variation as well as in the designing of the lay-out improvements. The results indicated that the 40% of the input waste was recovered as valuable products and that a large part of these (88%) complied with the standards of the recycling companies. The evaluation of the indicators led to the decision to modify the layout to improve the interception of some polymers for which the performance indicators were poor. In particular, two additional optical sorters have to be inserted to increase the yield indicator and to the overall performance of the facility. Definitely, the results of the work allowed to: increase the yield and purity of products’ flows; ensure the compliance of waste flows; increase the workability.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper presents a systematic study on the feasibility of using recycled tyre polymer (RTP) fibres for mitigating the damage of concrete induced by elevated temperatures. A series of tests were conducted to investigate the effect of RTP fibres on mechanical and thermal behaviour, pore pressure build-up and microstructural evolution of concrete exposed to elevated temperatures (20, 105, 250, 400 and 600 °C), based on which the mechanism of RTP fibres in mitigating damage of concrete was explored. Results indicate that the addition of RTP fibres effectively prevented pore pressure accumulation and significantly mitigated damage of concrete at high temperatures as the melting of RTP fibres and thermal incompatibility between RTP fibres and concrete promoted the formation of interconnected pore-microcrack network of concrete. RTP fibre was proved as a promising sustainable alternative to manufactured polymer fibres for enhancing high temperature and fire resistance of concrete. The optimal RTP fibre content was 1.2 kg/m3 considering the damage mitigation efficiency and strength loss.',\n",

Wettability of the samples was shown to play a significant role in their stability.

There are many alternative sustainable energy resources available for energy development, such as biomass, hydropower, and wind energy. Another interest in current research is the conversion of waste plastic material into liquefied fuel. The use of plastic materials implies high demand and causes depletion of natural resources. Moreover, tons of used plastic materials are ending up in the oceans, landfill or open burning causes pollution. So, a suitable waste management strategy implies controlling or reduce the pollution causing the environment. In this present work, a new method has been addressed to extract liquefied fuels from waste LDPE plastics. A single screw conveying machine setup is fabricated to mix the shredded waste plastics with Nano zeolite catalyst. The various weight percentage of plastic material and zeolite catalyst is mixed and subject to pyrolysis process. The distribution of nano zeolite catalyst with the plastic wastes was found to be even, which leads to improved heat transfer rate, pyrolysis temperature, and reduced reaction time also produces a higher pyrolytic oil yield of 7%. The FT-IR results of extracted pyrolytic oil outcomes showed clear peaks of carbon and oxidizing agent chemical bonds in all liquid oil samples also alkanes present in the oil are confirmed with the GC–MS results. The liquid oil has a higher heating value range of 9820–9860 Kcal/kg, which is close to the standard diesel fuel heating value.',\n",

Herein, the interpenetrating and synergistic dual-network hydrogel of Diels-Alder chemistry-based dynamic polyurethane substrates and polyaniline conductive polymer (PU-DA-1/1-PANI) was prepared and employed as a strain sensor. The PU-DA-1/1-PANI hydrogel exhibited large elongation at break of 500%, soft Young's modulus of 0.3 MPa, and robust tensile strength of 1.1 MPa. Meanwhile, the strain sensors with optimized composition presented an ideal conductivity of 7.9 S m−1, which could monitor the physical motions precisely and repeatedly with a gauge factor (GF) of 2.9. In addition, the mechanical performance and conductivity could be self-healed, which was enabled by the hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, reversible DA covalent bonds, and rearrangement of polymer chains. Built on the thermally stimuli-responsive nature of the DA covalent cross-linking points, the PU-DA-1/1-PANI composites could be recycled.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'The present rate of economic growth is unsustainable without saving of fossil energy like crude oil, natural gas or coal. Thus mankind has to rely on the alternate/renewable energy sources like biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. On the other hand, suitable waste management strategy is another important aspect of sustainable development. The growth of welfare levels in modern society during the past decades has brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of commodities, which indirectly generate waste. Plastics have been one of the materials with the fastest growth because of their wide range of applications due to versatility and relatively low cost. Since the duration of life of plastic products is relatively small, there is a vast plastics waste stream that reaches each year to the final recipients creating a serious environmental problem. Again, because disposal of post consumer plastics is increasingly being constrained by legislation and escalating costs, there is considerable demand for alternatives to disposal or land filling. Advanced research in the field of green chemistry could yield biodegradable/green polymers but is too limited at this point of time to substitute the non-biodegradable plastics in different applications. Once standards are developed for degradable plastics they can be used to evaluate the specific formulations of materials which will find best application in this state as regards their performance and use characteristics. Among the alternatives available are source reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of the inherent energy value through waste-to-energy incineration and processed fuel applications. Production of liquid fuel would be a better alternative as the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of fuels, around 40MJ/kg. Each of these options potentially reduces waste and conserves natural resources. Plastics recycling, continues to progress with a wide range of old and new technologies. Many research projects have been undertaken on chemical recycling of waste plastics to fuel and monomer. This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere. Further investigations are required to enhance the generation of value added products (fuel) with low investments without affecting the environment. The paper reviews the available literature in this field of active research and identifies the gaps that need further attention.',\n",

At the same time, currently unsustainable practices in the production and disposal of plastics continue to deplete our finite natural resources and create severe worldwide environmental consequences. In the search for feasible solutions to these issues, significant recent advances have been made in developing chemically recyclable plastics, which allow for recovery of the building-block chemicals via depolymerization, for repolymerization to virgin-quality plastics, or for creative repurposing into value-added materials. Among such recyclable plastics, polyesters derived from renewable cyclic esters possess real potential to meet these challenges. Hence, this review highlights the plastics derived from common four-, five-, six-, seven-, and eight-membered cyclic esters by covering synthetic strategies, material properties, and, particularly, chemical recyclability.

       " {'context': 'Forecasting emerging waste streams is challenging because of high uncertainty on the product lifetime and material composition, which should be taken into account to forecast the evolution in amount and composition of such waste streams. In addition, it is impossible to collect complete product lifetime data for emerging waste streams. For this reason, a method based on the theory of the bathtub curve, used in reliability engineering for taking account of large data uncertainties, is presented here and used to forecast the materials that will appear in emerging waste streams. The presented methodology is applied in a case study to forecast the material composition of waste from silicon based photovoltaic (PV) panels in the region of Flanders in Belgium. For this case study, the lifetime distribution of PV panels is determined based on the analysis of the amounts of waste collected by the European collection program “PV CYCLE”, as well as expert consultation. The results of the presented forecasts indicate not only that a wide variety of materials has been used in different concentrations in PV panels, but also that a high uncertainty remains on when these waste streams will have to be recycled. The results also demonstrate that up to 22,000 ton per year or up to 3.4kg per capita of silicon based PV panels will have to be recycled in Flanders in the near feature, which means that up to 0.2% of the annual environmental impact of Flanders could be mitigated by targeting all materials present in EoL PV panels for closed loop recycling.',\n",

Therefore other versatile alternatives such as pyrolysis should be employed to recover value-added products from waste. Benzoic acid a precursor in the food and beverage industry, derived from PET via thermochemical conversion opposed to the current manufacturing process from fossil fuel-based feedstock is considered as a promising approach. In this study, the effect of operating conditions i.e. temperature, catalyst to plastic mass ratio and volatiles residence time and their interactions on product yields and properties were studied.

The results indicate that the effects of recycled coarse aggregates, rubber particles and basalt fibers on the properties of concrete are significant. Compared with normal concrete, rubberized recycled concrete with 10% rubber particles and 40% recycled coarse aggregates has lower strength and better deformation performance. The effects of basalt fibers on the strength and deformation of rubberized recycled concrete are related to compositions and properties of concrete.

However, the practical application of Si anode is still high cost and hindered by huge volume change. It is significant to produce high-performance Si anode of LIBs inexpensively. Herein, we report the Si/N-doped carbon (Si/NC) composite anode materials constructed by recycling Si waste from the photovoltaic industry as raw materials after simple purification and polydopamine (PDA)-derived carbon coating. The Si micro/nano-plates coated with the NC can facilitate electron transfer and inhibit the volume expansion of Si to stabilize the structure of composites. The resulting Si/NC electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1139 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 200 cycles. Moreover, the full-cell (LiFePO4//Si/NC) presents excellent cycling performance (108 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 over 200 cycles). This work not only offers a reasonable solution for the acquirement of Si anode from the photovoltaic industry but also provides a new strategy for the preparation of anodes for the next generation of LIBs, which may bring great economic benefits.',\n",

To manufacture plastic bricks Different plastic materials can be used like Polyethylene (PE), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles etc. Among all plastics, the consumption of polyethylene is highest. Plastic bags are collected, cleaned and crushed into fine aggregates. Then mixed in a different ratio to get high strength bricks having thermal and sound insulation property.

All systems were scaled to flows that would be realistically encountered in full–scale production systems, and several scenarios covering the production of supplementary feed blocks, fermented blocks, and silage for cattle feeding were considered. Plantain waste composition was determined experimentally. SuperPro Designer was used to simulate the process flowsheets. Process net present values were estimated using a project life of 15 years and an interest rate of 5.36%. Results suggested that fresh residues from plantain agro-industry are not recommended for dairy cattle consumption due to their high contents of moisture and neutral and acid detergent fibres, which provide few nutrients. Amending the residues with 19% maize forage resulted in a far better feed, with an estimated nutritional content of (on a dry basis): 28.34% neutral detergent fibre, 17.08% acid detergent fibre, 30.40% non–fibrous carbohydrates, and 34.52% moisture. The process flowsheets were modified by including a new step for moisture extraction as well. The feasible process for utilising plantain waste with the highest net present value (15.0 M$) was the production of supplementary feed blocks using screw press moisture extraction technology. This process can be incorporated as an alternative processing pathway into the design of a biorefinery using plantain waste as feedstock.',\n",

To establish a reliable disposal platform, this study employed a pyrolysis platform to valorize plastics into value-added fuels. To confer more environmentally resilient process, CO2 was used as a feedstock to enhance the process efficiency from a perspective of the yield of flammable gases. To this end, waste toy brick (WTB) was used as a model compound. The exact types of plastics (polyacrylonitrile, polybutadiene, polystyrene, and polymethyl methacrylate) in WTB were experimentally determined. In pyrolysis of WTB, the complicated mixture of benzene derivatives was inevitably generated. To detoxify them by means of syngas (H2/CO) production, catalytic pyrolysis was performed. Co catalyst effectively induced chemical bond scissions, leading to substantially enhanced H2 formation. Also, the gas phase reactions (GPRs) between CO2 and volatile compounds over Co catalyst expedited the production rate of CO, and such CO enhancement effectively offered a chance to mitigate toxic chemical generations. The synergistic contribution of CO2 and Co catalyst enhanced syngas formation more than 25 times in reference to pyrolysis of WTB without Co catalyst. The GPRs also greatly prevented catalyst deactivation.',\n",

       " {'context': '               Reducing energy consumption and manufacturing any related thermal insulation materials for solving environmental problem by recycling industrial and domestic waste becomes a relevant initiative today. It is also an alternative to many possible ways on other research work to carry out the study on heat transfer properties of every recycled material. An example of work being carried out is using recycled materials such as polypropylene (PP) waste (PP; ground in powder form) with plaster materials such as cement and sand. Fabricated composites, namely mortar block samples, were also coated with a multilayer recycled bio-based plastic coating material origin from waste cooking oils. The ground PP waste loading range 100–300 m3 was added to the mortar block, and the sample were exposed to sunlight at a specific time frame. The recorded temperature for each sunlight irradiated samples in predetermined interval time was used in Fourier’s equation to determine the heat transfer rate. The highest composition of waste PP filler materials shows a higher rate of heat transfer due to a high portion of fine aggregate possessed higher thermal conductivity compared to those with a high portion of course aggregate. Evidently, the lowest PP waste composition ratio contributed to the lowest heat transfer rate as recorded at the bottom surface of the specimen due to the ability of the material to transfer heat is reduced in the composites. This characteristic is also revealed the same properties when applied with recycled bio-based coating on the mortar block surfaces. It is suggested that the high rate of heat transfer polymer composite material is suitable for inner plastering while the low rate of heat transfer material can be used for outer plastering in order to maintain and control the building׳s thermal comfort.

       " {'context': 'The crisis brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic has altered global waste generation dynamics and therefore has necessitated special attention. The unexpected fluctuations in waste composition and quantity also require a dynamic response from policymakers. This study highlights the challenges faced by the solid waste management sector during the pandemic and the underlying opportunities to fill existing loopholes in the system. The study presents specific cases for biomedical waste, plastic waste, and food waste management - all of which have been a major cause of concern during this crisis. Further, without active citizen participation and cooperation, commingled virus-laden biomedical waste with the regular solid waste stream pose significant negative health and safety issues to sanitation workers. Single-use plastic usage is set to bounce back due to growing concerns of hygiene, particularly from products used for personal protection and healthcare purposes. It is expected that household food waste generation may reduce due to increased conscious buying of more non-perishable items during lockdown and due to concerns of food shortage. However, there is a chance of increase in food waste from the broken supply chains such as food items getting stuck on road due to restriction in vehicle movements, lack of workers in the warehouse for handling the food products, etc. The study also stresses the need for building localized resilient supply chains to counter such situations during future pandemics. While offering innovative solutions to existing waste management challenges, the study also suggests some key recommendations to the policymakers to help handle probable future pandemics if any holistically.',\n",

The catalyst deactivated slightly after 5 cycles. Possible reaction routes were proposed and it was found that terephthalic acid, benzoic acid, related esters and amides were the major intermediates from PET to nitriles. Acetonitrile could be produced from acetaldehyde and its corresponding imines. In addition, 32.1 C% TPN with high purity (>95%) was obtained via freezing recrystallization.

Results substantiate assumed hypothesis that blending of SS and PET at 3:1 provided higher synergistic effect and RMS value, which in turn indicated maximum formation of hot volatiles during pyrolysis. Kinetic analysis confirmed that individual SS and PET required higher activation energy while blended SS and PET at 3:1 ratio required lower activation energy to start the reaction. The thermodynamic and kinetic analysis confirmed that biomass had complex reaction kinetics which depends on reaction rate as well as its order.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This report summarizes current developments in the United States and 18 other industrial countries regarding packaging waste. It presents available data concerning the types, amounts, and methods of managing such waste and provides information concerning the policies established or under consideration to reduce the amount of such waste being disposed. The countries discussed are all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, waste disposal capacity has become more scarce in most OECD countries. As a result, waste management policies have focused on efforts to reduce and recycle major components of the waste stream. Packaging represents about one-third of municipal solid waste in many countries. Because of this, measures to reduce the amount and toxicity of packaging and to encourage its recycling are currently being considered in at least 18 OECD countries. In addition, the EC and the Nordic Council are developing programs to address packaging on a regional basis. The report is divided into four main sections. Section I summarizes available information for the OECD countries. The second section discusses waste generation and recycling rates for six types of packaging material: paper, glass, metal, plastic, wood, and composites. The third section discusses key questions raised by the information presented in the report. The fourth briefly discusses packaging waste issues facing the Congress. In general, the report finds, other countries use less packaging than the United States, recycle more of it, and are considering policy measures stronger than the measures generally being considered in America. As noted in detail, other countries have adopted or are developing requirements that: &#x02022; • set mandatory requirements for packaging waste reduction; &#x02022; • require reusable or refillable packaging; &#x02022; • impose taxes to discourage single-use packages; &#x02022; • prohibit the use of non-recyclable packaging, &#x02022; • prohibit or limit disposal of packaging, and &#x02022; • require manufacturers of packaging materials to collect and recycle post-consumer waste. Perhaps the most fundamental issue raised by these approaches is whether local governments will continue to bear responsibility for funding and operating recycling programs or whether all or some of this responsibility might be shifted to industry. To date, this issue has not been joined in the Congress directly; however, there is a growing consensus in other countries concerning the advantages of industry responsibility.',\n",

The effect of chain structure of PE on the yield, morphology, microstructure, phase structure and thermal stability of CNMs, including cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CS-CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), were investigated by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. In addition, the degradation products from different chain structures of PE under the catalysis of CuBr were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. It was demonstrated that the branched structure played an important effect in the degradation products of PE. The dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE were remarkably promoted by Br radicals from the decomposition of CuBr to form a large amount of light hydrocarbons and a relatively small amount of aromatics, favoring the formation of long and straight CS-CNTs. However, the degradation of LDPE was not obviously influenced by Br radicals due to its high extent of branched structure, while the random cleavage of HDPE was accelerated with the formation of a lot of olefins with long chains, resulting in the formation of short and winding CNFs. This work will contribute to the conversion of mixed waste polyolefin into high value-added CNMs.',\n",

       " {'context': \"The generation and management of solid waste on college campuses have presented challenges to pursuing institutional sustainability. Characterizing, analyzing, and understanding the composition of a campus’ residential waste stream is a critical first step toward developing successful and effective waste management strategies across university campuses. This study presents a multi-year (2008–2011) assessment of the composition and spatial variability of the residential waste stream, by both weight and volume, at Furman University, a small private Liberal Arts Institution in Greenville, SC, United States. Waste audits were conducted on a dumpster by dumpster basis over the three-year period, with garbage being sorted into eight separate waste categories. Of the total 587.4kg and 14.8m3 of residential waste sampled, 25% by weight and 41% by volume could have been recycled under the university's current waste management program, and 61% by weight and 63% by volume could have been diverted from the landfill through a combination of the university's recycling plan, the county's recycling program, and the composting of food waste. Distinct spatial differences were found in the composition of the waste stream with regards to the glass, compost material, and cardboard content among the different housing complexes. Our analysis found the observed variability to be the result of differences in the age and class of the student residents, the meal plans of the residents, social patterns of alcohol consumption within the residence halls, and the presence or absence and quantity of kitchens in each building. Design of an efficient waste management program requires not only an assessment of the waste stream, but also an understanding of the mechanisms and behaviors responsible for generating this garbage. The utility of site specific audits lies within their ability to capture these spatial differences in campus residential waste streams, allowing for specific recommendations for individual residential buildings on strategies for minimizing waste and improving recycling efforts.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Past works have used electronic waste (E-waste) plastic as a raw material for the production of plastic aggregate to be used as a substitute for natural aggregates. However, the results have shown that the plastic aggregate reduces the strength properties of resulting concrete limiting its application to non-structural components. Nano graphite platelets (NGPs) are nanofillers that significantly improve the density and hardness of the cementitious composite due to reduction in porosity and reinforcement in microstructure. In the current study, NGPs have been utilized to increase the strength of plastic concrete. The natural coarse aggregates are partially substituted by 25% of E-waste plastic coarse aggregate. Locally available NGPs are utilized, and their structural characteristics were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. A dispersion test is carried out and a ratio of 0.6:1 (surfactant:NGPs) is found to yield maximum dispersion. Different dosages of NGPs (1%, 3%, and 5%) have been introduced into plastic concrete. This research work aims to explore the fresh, mechanical, durability, and microstructure characteristics. The mechanical properties of the cementitious composites declined with the incorporation of E-waste plastic aggregates which were significantly enhanced by incorporating NGPs. The specimens containing 25% of plastic aggregate and 5% of NGPs showed the hardened density, compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength to increase by 2.16%, 13.56%, 15.53%, and 31.42%, respectively compared to the samples without NGPs. Sorptivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity values are found to decrease by 56.5% and increase by 2.53%, respectively for plastic concrete with 5% NGPs compared to the control mix. SEM-EDX spectroscopy was carried out to examine microstructure investigation and it was found that by the inclusion of NGPs in the concrete composites, the hydrated crystals stacked one over the other and became massive and thicker implying that the addition of NGPs is a promising reinforcing agent in plastic concrete.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This work focuses on the pyrolysis-gasification of real waste polymers in one stage tubular reactor with and without catalyst at 550 °C and 850 °C. Moreover, the possibility for dry reforming by in situ CO2 generation was also investigated using dolomite. To enhance the syngas production from waste plastics, Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthetized by wet impregnation with 4.82% of Ni, then the catalyst was loaded by further elements in ~2% concentration (Ca, Ce, La, Mg, and Mn). The composition of gases and liquid products was measured by gas-chromatography, while the coke deposition on the spent catalysts was followed by temperature-programmed oxidation. It was found that a large amount of amorphous carbons was produced at 550 °C with Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The in-situ addition of the carbon-dioxide can enhance the production of syngas because both the hydrogen and carbon-monoxide concentration can drastically increase. Furthermore, the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface can be reduced by using dolomite. Based on the results of the various Me/Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts, the Ce/Ni/ZSM-5 was the most promising catalyst for the production of syngas (122.6 mmol/g at 850 °C). While, Mg/Ni/ZSM-5 showed less effect on the decomposition reaction, as low syngas yield was produced (62.8 mmol/g at 850 °C). The maximum yield of pyrolysis oil was achieved at 550 °C for the process without the catalyst.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Significant amount of waste associated with end of life vehicles enter waste stream each year and are usually disposed of in landfill, creating an environmental burden. Recycling automotive waste is very tedious and difficult due to its heterogeneous composition and nature. It is critically required to develop a solution to recycle and reuse these potential resources. In this paper, a novel recycling approach is established to produce lightweight aggregate by incorporating automotive shredded residual (ASR) plastics into clay at 1200°C. The physical properties of lightweight aggregate such as bulk density, porosity and water absorption have been investigated. ASR plastics as pore-forming or gas releasing agent increased the porosity of the clay mixture. Incorporation of 2wt% of ASR plastics into clay composite lead to a benefit of approximately 30% bulk density decrease and 40% porosity increase compared to the reference clay material used in this study. The obtained superior lightweight and porous aggregate products by using ASR plastics can be used in thermal insulation materials and also as substrates in soilless cultivation. This innovative approach could also help reduce the volume of autoplastics in landfills and could be a potential replacement of conventional additives in manufacturing composite materials for building applications.',\n",

H2S concentration exhibited a similar spatial distribution during both monitoring campaigns. The highest values were recorded in the mechanical treatment hall of the MBT plant and the lowest were consistently found in the sealed landfill, indicating that fresh waste, containing a high load of fermentable organic matter, was a major source of H2S to the ambient air. 50 % of the data obtained in the MBT plant were higher than the limit value recommended by the Portuguese regulation on occupational health, and therefore emphasize the importance of conducting routine H2S monitoring and equipment maintenance programs in MSW management facilities, in order to promote a safe and healthy work environment.',\n",

However, the presence of contaminants in MWOO including trace organics, trace metals and physical contaminants such as microplastic fragments has raised concerns about potential negative effects on soil health and agriculture following land application. Here, we used multiple lines of evidence to examine the effects of land application of MWOO containing microplastics in three soils to a variety of terrestrial biota. Treatments included unamended soil, MWOO-amended soil and MWOO-amended soil into which additional high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics were added. Tests were conducted in soil media that had been incubated for 0, 3 or 9 months.

       " {'context': 'The application of waste oils as pyrolysis feedstocks to produce high-grade biofuels is receiving extensive attention, which will diversify energy supplies and address environmental challenges caused by waste oils treatment and fossil fuel combustion. Waste oils are the optimal raw materials to produce biofuels due to their high hydrogen and volatile matter content. However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament. The bio-oil produced by the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high yield and HHV with great potential to replace fossil fuel, but contains a high acid value of about 120 mg KOH/g. Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio-oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, co-pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio-oil yield and quality. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the production of biofuels using conventional and advanced pyrolysis of waste oils.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Food waste (FW) is a widespread problem affecting most countries in the world. Proper segregation is significant as FW will be contaminated and may not be valorised to value-added commodities once mixed with other wastes. However, public engagement and training to ensure proper segregation can be laborious and time-consuming. An uncomplicated waste segregation process with minimal behavioural change is essential to encourage the public to practise FW segregation at source. Considering the current FW practices and government policies in Malaysia, a novel management framework for FW segregation at source using an optical sorting system, followed by FW valorisation to biogas via anaerobic digestion, is proposed. A life cycle assessment study with four FW disposal and treatment scenarios is conducted. The results indicate that turning FW to electricity via anaerobic digestion is the most environmentally friendly scenario, with 4.92 × 10−4 DALY and 6.30 PDF.m2.y avoided impacts for human health and ecosystem quality, respectively. By turning 80% of daily FW to electricity, it reduces 0.4% of total carbon emissions and contributes 1.1% of total electricity consumption in Malaysia. A sustainable FW management framework is crucial to reduce reliance on landfills and promote circular economy by valorising FW to renewable energy.',\n",

       " {'context': 'An asphalt concrete has been modified by adding four polymeric wastes: polyethylene (PE) from micronized containers, polypropylene (PP) from ground caps, polystyrene (PS) from hangers and rubber from end-of-life tyres (ELT). These polymeric wastes were selected according to their availability, homogeneity and economic criteria considering the big amount of material required to build a road. The dry method has been used to modify the bituminous mixture due to its simplicity and the possibility to be carried out in any asphalt plant without important modifications. This is very important in order to spread the process and recycle the polymeric waste in the same place where it is produced, hence improving the environmental impact. The reference asphalt mixture and the four modified asphalt concretes have been analysed separately and their performance compared, evaluating their resistance against plastic deformation, stiffness, fatigue resistance and workability. The Master curve and the Black diagram of the mixtures were also calculated. The results showed that the use of polymeric wastes significantly increased the stiffness of the reference mixture in all cases, but especially when PE, PP and ELT were used. However, none of these materials significantly modifies the fatigue behaviour of the reference mixture. Regarding the resistance against plastic deformation, the use of both PE and ELT led to an increase of the resistance, whereas PP did not modify it and PS decreased it. As for workability, the energy of compaction of the modified mixtures did not suffer any important change. Therefore, according to the results obtained, PE, PP and ELT can be used to modify asphalt mixtures since they improve or do not change their properties. On the other hand, PS should be further studied because of the contradictory results obtained, and only when plastic deformation is not a problem this material could be used.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The effects of a closed-loop recycling methodology are evaluated for degradation using a discontinuous carbon fibre polyamide 6 (CFPA6) composite material. The process comprises two fundamental steps: reclamation and remanufacture. The material properties are analysed over two recycling loops, and CFPA6 specimens show a total decrease of 39.7% (±3.5) in tensile stiffness and 40.4% (±6.1) in tensile strength. The results of polymer characterisation and fibre analysis suggested that the stiffness reduction was likely due to fibre misalignments primarily caused by fibre agglomerations, as a result of incomplete fibre separation, and by fibre breakages from high compaction pressures. The ultimate tensile strain was statistically invariable as a function of recycling loop which indicated minimal variation in polymer structure as a function of recycling loop. To the authors’ best knowledge, the mechanical performance of the virgin CFPA6 is the highest observed for any aligned discontinuous carbon fibre thermoplastic composites in the literature. This is also true for recycled specimens, which are the highest observed for any recycled thermoplastic composite, and, for any recycled discontinuous carbon fibre composite with either thermosetting or thermoplastic matrices.',\n",

The maximum recovery rate (1.135 mg·min−1) was recorded under the optimized conditions (160 A·m−2 current density, 7 mL·min−1 leachate flow rate, and 0.8 mol·L–1 ferric concentration). The selective columnar extraction process was employed to extract gold, wherein the highest extraction efficiency (69.39%) was obtained under optimized conditions of 0.7 mol·L−1 thiourea, 0.6 mol·L−1 hydrochloric acid, 0.8 mol·L−1 ferric chloride, 120 min circulation time, and 6 mL·min−1 leachate flow rate. The adsorption process was used for the recovery of gold, which was investigated under the kinetic as well as equilibrium adsorption processes. The adsorption curves conformed to the Langmuir model and followed the first-order kinetics. The adsorption rate decreased with the increasing values of pH, temperature, adsorbent size, while the rate increased with the stirring speed and adsorbent quantity. Finally, acidic extraction under anaerobic and optimal conditions was performed to extract and selectively recover rare-earth elements. The rare-earth elements were initially precipitated in their sulfate forms and subsequently transformed into corresponding hydroxides and oxides. The total recovery efficiencies for cerium and neodymium were found to be 91.7% and 86.7%, respectively.',\n",

Moreover, light molecular weight HC constituting the gaseous fraction were identified. A chemical kinetic analysis of the cracking reactions, was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of yielding the maximum oil product. The oil product recovered had a high proportion of aliphatic HC especially in the range of C8 to C12, whilst aromatic HC were of lower proportion. The carbon number of the pyrolysis oil was noted to increase proportionally with the increasing operating temperature.

During the gasification experiments the effect of bed temperature is determined in the range of 600–900 °C and the effect of air-to-fuel equivalence ratio (ER) is investigated in the range of 0.15–0.30. Gas analysis is conducted using a non-dispersive infrared analyzer and gas chromatograph. As the operating temperature and ER increases, the gas yield increases, and tar yield decreases. The yield of CO, CH4, H2, and C2H2 in the gas product increases with temperature, whereas those of CO2, C2–C3 hydrocarbons decreases. The increase in ER decreases the concentrations of CO, CH4, H2, and C2–C3 hydrocarbons and increases the CO2 in the gas product. H2/CO ratio substantially increases with rising temperature and decreases with rising ER. Carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) and cold gas efficiency reach peak at 800 °C and ER of 0.25.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) study was conducted for an open-field strawberry (strb) produced in California. The evaluation covered the full supply chain of strawberry, which also included the impacts of food waste generated at each phase of the life cycle. The supply chain included farming, retail, consumption, and end-of-life treatments of waste generated. Data on strawberry farming (included cultivation, harvest and packaging) were collected from the selected farms, with an average strawberry acreage of 138 acres. The defined functional unit (FU) was 1 kg-strb, consumed at the consumer stage, including food waste. Life cycle inventory (LCI) data for post-farm (retail and consumer stage) were based on the available literature and engineering estimates. The ReCiPe 2016 method was used to calculate the potential environmental impacts. The total GHG emissions calculated per FU was 1.45 kg CO2eq; freshwater eutrophication potential was 4.43*10−4 kg Peq/FU, fossil resource scarcity was 0.46 kg oileq/FU. Transportation contributed to about 32% of the total GHG emissions, the use of all forms of plastics (including packaging PET, labels, and field plastics) contributed 18% of the total GHG emissions, while their treatments contributed ∼1% (including the credits from the related recycling process). The use of corrugated boxes contributed 15% of the GHG emissions, while end-of-life treatment provided credits by –7% of the total impact. Food waste treatment contributed ∼15% to the total GHG emissions. For fossil resource scarcity, cultivation along with packaging contributed 71% of the total impact, followed by retail and consumer (25% and 11%, respectively), which was mainly due to transportation. Results showed that the use of recycled packaging materials and the adoption of a suitable recycling process are effective strategies to lower the environmental impacts. The study also showed that with changes in crop yields by ±10%, as compared to the reported yields, most of the selected environmental impacts could change by ± 3–4%, while water consumption would vary by −9% (with +10% yield increase) and increase by 11% (with −10% yield). Reducing food waste by 10% could lower the total GHG emissions by around 1%.',\n",

This two-step pyrolysis was conducted to understand the effect of a 300 °C thermal pretreatment with the auger reactor before main pyrolysis on the chlorine removal. The fixed-bed pyrolysis of a solid product obtained after the pretreatment produced an oil with 464 ppm chlorine. An oil with only 14 ppm of organic chlorine could be obtained when a solid containing CaO was pyrolyzed in the fixed-bed reactor. Thermal pretreatment also caused changes in the yield and product composition; pretreatment led to an increase in gas yield and aromatic content of the oil. In the continuous two-stage pyrolysis of a waste plastic mixture having 3 wt% polyvinyl chloride at 730 °C, chlorinated gases were removed in parallel from the outlet of the auger reactor line and through a CaO hot filter; this produced an oil with 6.3 ppm organic chlorine. In the two-stage pyrolysis, an aromatic-rich oil (80 wt%) was obtained. The two-stage pyrolysis successfully converted the waste plastic mixture into an oil which could be acceptable as a feedstock for petrochemical industries.',\n",

As a result, it was found that, on average, 95,415 tons of E-waste is imported into Pakistan annually. It contains a variety of metals such as gold, silver, copper and non-metals like plastics and glass as well as hazardous materials. It was also found out that all the recycling activity takes place in informal sectors without any consideration to environmental pollution and safety of workers.

       " {'context': 'We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classifying different types of plastic materials that are commonly found in mixed plastic waste (MPW) streams. The CNN framework uses experimental ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra to classify ten different plastic types. An important aspect of this type of spectral data is that it can be collected in real-time; as such, this approach provides an avenue for enabling the high-throughput characterization of MPW. The proposed CNN architecture (which we call PlasticNet) uses a Gramian angular representation of the spectra. We show that this 2-dimensional (2D) matrix representation highlights correlations between different frequencies (wavenumber) and leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy, compared to the direct use of spectra (a 1D vector representation). We also demonstrate that PlasticNet can reach an overall classification accuracy of over 87% and can classify certain plastics with 100% accuracy. Our framework also uses saliency maps to analyze spectral features that are most informative.',\n",

The chemical constituents of the additives and filler contents of the recycled polypropylenes are determined through thermo-physico-chemical analysis. Tensile and bending tests performed at different strain rates allow identifying the mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus, the yield stress, the maximum stress, and the failure mechanisms. The results obtained are compared with non-recycled polypropylene and with few researches to explain the combined effect of additives.

The term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world.

Zero Waste Manufacturing (ZWM) is believed as a roadmap for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of “Waste” can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing process, use of optimization tools and sustainable manufacturing theories, development of precision manufacturing systems, etc. This review article is taken up to discuss various recent sustainable manufacturing ideas applied in the prominent sectors with an aim to either re-cycle/re-use the discarded ones or to produce a fresh part in eco-friendly manners.

The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions, with a 1 % (w/w) of HZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis. Three different temperatures were tested in each case and the influence of the reaction time was evaluated at 500\\u202f°C and 430\\u202f°C for thermal pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, respectively. Thermal pyrolysis of HDPE produced the higher amount of solid products (80 %wt. or higher) under the form of a waxy cream-colored material (wax) for all the experimental sets. For catalytic pyrolysis, the major product fraction was always liquid. The analysis of the liquid products showed that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C5 to C11, with a higher yield on C8 and C9 in the case of thermal pyrolysis and on C6 and C7 for catalytic pyrolysis. The aim of this study was the development of an integrated reactor/separation system to increase the middle olefin production.

The discovery of microbes and enzymes that can selectively degrade mixed-plastic waste enables to recycle plastics. Knowledge on how to achieve efficient and selective enzymatic plastic degradation is a key prerequisite for biocatalytic recycling of plastics. Wild-type natural polymer degrading enzymes such as cellulases pose often selective non-catalytic binding domains that facilitate a targeting and efficient degradation of polymeric substrates. Recently identified polyester hydrolases with synthetic polymer degrading activities, however, lack in general such selective domains. Inspired by nature, we herein report a protocol for the identification and engineering of anchor peptides which serve as non-catalytic binding domains specifically toward synthetic plastics. The identified anchor peptides hold the promise to be fused to known plastic degrading enzymes and thereby enhance the efficiency of biocatalytic plastic recycling processes.               ',\n",

Furthermore, fresh raw materials for concrete manufacturing are still required, while it is projected that they will soon be in short supply due to ever growing consumption. This study focuses on producing a stabilized construction material with better mechanical strength than traditional concrete. A novel method for recycling demolished concrete and plastic waste by compacting concrete and plastic powders under various pressures and temperatures is proposed. The effects of forming conditions on the bending strength of the compacted plastic–concrete (CPC) are analyzed. Furthermore, the water absorption ability and micro-structure of the CPC are also determined. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of CPC and show promising aspects of CPC related to recycling both types of waste in concrete applications, achieving a closed loop for concrete recycling and a high-volume plastic recycling ratio. SEM results showed that the hot-pressing method ensures a good fusion between concrete and plastic particles. Almost all the specimens formed under different conditions possessed a superior bending strength than traditional concrete, and its strength remains stable with up to 75% plastic composition in the specimen. Therefore, the proposed method reveals the feasibility of large-scale plastics recycling in construction, and makes the CPC competitive with other construction materials.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Many methods have been reported and used to include recycling in life cycle assessments (LCAs). This paper evaluates six widely used methods: three substitution methods (i.e. substitution based on equal quality, a correction factor, and alternative material), allocation based on the number of recycling loops, the recycled-content method, and the equal-share method. These six methods were first compared, with an assumed hypothetical 100% recycling rate, for an aluminium can and a disposable polystyrene (PS) cup. The substitution and recycled-content method were next applied with actual rates for recycling, incineration and landfilling for both product systems in selected countries. The six methods differ in their approaches to credit recycling. The three substitution methods stimulate the recyclability of the product and assign credits for the obtained recycled material. The choice to either apply a correction factor, or to account for alternative substituted material has a considerable influence on the LCA results, and is debatable. Nevertheless, we prefer incorporating quality reduction of the recycled material by either a correction factor or an alternative substituted material over simply ignoring quality loss. The allocation-on-number-of-recycling-loops method focusses on the life expectancy of material itself, rather than on a specific separate product. The recycled-content method stimulates the use of recycled material, i.e. credits the use of recycled material in products and ignores the recyclability of the products. The equal-share method is a compromise between the substitution methods and the recycled-content method. The results for the aluminium can follow the underlying philosophies of the methods. The results for the PS cup are additionally influenced by the correction factor or credits for the alternative material accounting for the drop in PS quality, the waste treatment management (recycling rate, incineration rate, landfilling rate), and the source of avoided electricity in case of waste incineration. The results for the PS cup, which are less dominated by production of virgin material than aluminium can, furthermore depend on the environmental impact categories. This stresses the importance to consider other impact categories besides the most commonly used global warming impact. The multitude of available methods complicates the choice of an appropriate method for the LCA practitioner. New guidelines keep appearing and industries also suggest their own preferred method. Unambiguous ISO guidelines, particularly related to sensitivity analysis, would be a great step forward in making more robust LCAs.',\n",

The deposition of such huge amount of wastes in common land causes a lot of environmental hazards. Employing these industrial wastes in water remediation serves as an environment-friendly, cost-effective, and efficient approach for their utilization. Adsorption is one of the most valuable scientific tools for industries as well as academia. It has a wide range of applications and is especially beneficial for environmental remediation due to its explicit utility in the purification of water from a wide range of impurities such as toxic heavy metals, dyes, organic pollutants, inorganic ions, pharmaceutical wastes, and other contaminants. Some of the industrial wastes such as fly ash, lignin, red mud, blast furnace slag, sludge, and dust can be used as efficient adsorbents for the removal of toxic impurities from water. Efficient and novel adsorbents are the ones that purify wastewater as well as contribute to the minimization of the cost of the remediation process and the recyclization of industrial wastes, simultaneously reducing environmental hazards. This chapter consists of discussion on a few industrial wastes and their modification to form low-cost, novel adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Production and utilization of the industrial wastes, removal of specific impurities along with the challenges of the removal process, and the factors and trends observed in the adsorption process are highlighted.

In this study, an evaluation of optimum conditions for some cleaning parameters by using characterization results of effluents was accomplished. Although, a complete evaluation of process parameters has not been possible, good correlations between cleaner performance and effluent parameter measurements were achieved. The environmental pollution promoted through cleaning of plastics during the recycling process of polyolefins and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated.

Using fibers, the cracks can be better controlled and stabilized in the concrete. It will allow to lead to smaller cracks compared to when using a concrete without fibers. Besides, fibers can help prevent local damages, such as chipping of the edges and segment corners. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of recycled steel fibers added in concrete to form a segment. To check the effectiveness of recycled steel fibers at the installation stage, a study was performed by using laboratory tests, numerical modeling, an analytical approach, and recommended criteria. In the experimental section, several volume fractions (0, 30, 40, 50, and 60 kg m 3 of recycled steel fibers) were used for the tests. Then, compressive strength, splitting tensile, and bending tests were performed. Finally, the results obtained from analytical relationships and numerical modeling were compared with the laboratory results and criteria to evaluate the feasibility of using recycled steel fibers. According to the results, it was found that recycled steel fibers can be used as reinforcement in a hybrid reinforcement (rebars + fibers) to reduce crack width and even rebars consumption to sustain the efforts due to thrust jacks.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The catalytic degradation of linear low-density (lldPE) polyethylene over HY-zeolite catalyst was studied in a semi-batch reactor. One of the important problems encountered during catalytic pyrolysis of macromolecules is the contact with the catalyst, which is known to affect the product distribution and the quality of the coke formed. A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined. Moreover, the pre-degradation results were compared with the results obtained using normal mixing procedure. The results obtained showed that, pre-degradation promotes the liquid fraction by a factor of more than one-fold increase at the expense of the gas fraction and the coke yield. The optimal liquid fraction with pre-degradation was obtained at low reaction temperature and catalyst amount respectively, i.e. high polymer to catalyst ratio, making it economically viable method for the degradation of lldPE. The coke content was analysed using TGA in nitrogen atmosphere to remove the soft coke and then in air isothermally at the final temperature to burn the hard coke. The TGA results of the coked sample show less concentration of coke components on the catalyst using the pre-degradation method as compared to the normal mixing which shows high concentration of coke components especially at low reaction temperature. Moreover, the majority of the coke components produced using the pre-degradation method were soft coke, making it more efficient for the re-usability of the catalyst. The liquid samples collected were analysed using gas chromatography and the products distribution were presented in the form of boiling point distribution curves. The bulk of the liquid products produced were lighter fractions with a peak around the gasoline range.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was applied to evaluate the combustion behaviour of combining three feedstocks coal, biomass and polyethylene as a tri-fuel for various blend ratios. The feed materials assessed were bituminous coal (BC ), anthracite coal (AC ), camphor wood (CW ), wheat straw (WS ) and polyethylene-terephthalate (PET ). The kinetic parameters of the tri-fuel blends were assessed using a Coats-Redfern integral method. The kinetic analysis indicates that the tri-fuel combustion mechanisms follow the diffusion model (D1 & D4) and can be separated in to three distinct stages. TGA analysis demonstrated that an increase in the blend ratio of biomass (CW /WS ) and plastic (PET ) enhances the combustion properties with respect to lowering the ignition (Ti ) and burnout (Th ) temperatures, along with an increase in the combustion stability indices (Cs /Csi ). This enhancement of the combustion behaviour is more evident for the lower volatile anthracite coal tri-fuel blends. As the blend ratio of the anthracite coal is lowered the overall hydrocarbon-volatile content is increased as a function of increasing the biomass and plastic blend ratios. Laboratory scale analytical analysis of blending biomass, plastic with either bituminous coal or anthracite coal demonstrates a synergistic influence which is observed to benefit the overall combustion behaviour (enhanced mass loss rate and burnout). However, further investigation of tri-fuel blending streams assessing the combustion performance (T i , T h , Ci , Csi , Ea , flue gas emissions and ash chemistry) is required at pilot and plant scale.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Nanocellulose has achieved an inimitable place and value in nano-materials research sector. Promising and exclusive physical, chemical and biological properties of nanocellulose make it an attractive and ideal material for various high end-user applications. Conventionally, the base material for nanocellulose i.e. cellulose is being extracted from various lignocellulosic raw materials (like wood, agro-industrial-residues, etc.) using pulping followed by bleaching sequences. As an alternate to lignocellulosic raw materials, waste paper also showed potential as a competent raw material due to its abundant availability and high cellulosic content (60–70%) with comparatively less hemicelluloses (10–20%) and lignin (5–10%) without any harsh treatments. The production yields of nanocellulose were reported to vary from 1.5% to 64% depending upon the waste papers and treatments given. The diameters of these nanocelluloses were reported in the range of 2–100\\u202fnm and crystallinity range around 54–95%. Thermal degradation of waste paper nanocellulose was varied from 187\\u202f°C to 371\\u202f°C. Although these properties are comparable with the nanocellulose obtained from lignocellulosic raw materials, yet waste paper is an underutilized source for nanocellulose preparation due to its ordinary fate of recycling, dumping and incineration. In the sight of necessity and possibility of waste paper utilization, this article reviews the outcomes of research carried out for preparation of nanocellulose using waste paper as a source of cellulose. There is a need of sincere investigation to convert this valuable waste to wealth i.e. waste papers to nanocellulose, which will be helpful in solid waste management to protect environment in economical way.',\n",

First, diethylene glycol (DEG) and cationic surfactant were added to a 1% TEMPO-CNF/water dispersion, and the mixture was agitated to prepare a foam. This foam was oven-dried at 40 °C for ~2 days to prepare a bulky and soft product. This oven-dried TEMPO-CNF/surfactant/DEG was added to maleic anhydride-modified polyethylene at 120–135 °C, and the mixture was elastically kneaded to prepare a TEMPO-CNF/surfactant/polyethylene master batch. The DEG and water molecules present in the oven-dried product were completely removed during kneading. The master batch was further kneaded with polyethylene to prepare TEMPO-CNF/cationic surfactant/polyethylene composite sheets. No detectable aggregates of TEMPO-CNFs were observed in the scanning electron microscopy images of the composite sheets. The yield stress and modulus of the sheets linearly increased with increasing TEMPO-CNF content up to ~8 vol%. Therefore, we successfully reinforced polyethylene with TEMPO-CNFs using our oven-drying and elastic kneading method.',\n",

The panels were made through air-forming and hot press. The effects of the fiber and coupling agent concentration on tensile, flexural, internal bond properties and water absorption and thickness swelling of wood–fiber plastic composites were studied. The use of maleated polypropylene as coupling agent improved the compatibility between the fiber and both plastic matrices and mechanical properties of the resultant composites compared well with those of non-coupled ones. Based on the findings in this work, it appears that recycled materials can be used to manufacture value-added panels without having any significant adverse influence on board properties.

China has the largest coastal population in the world. For this emerging economy, the sources of debris might be different from those in regions at different developmental stages. As a typical coastal tourist city and a special economic zone in East China, there are multiple sources of marine debris continuously produced around Xiamen. Marine debris characterization here could provide insights into regulatory measures. Therefore, the abundance and composition of marine debris around Xiamen were investigated. Average densities of floating, beached, benthic macro-debris and floating microplastics (0.5\\u202fmm - 5\\u202fmm) were 3963\\u202f±\\u202f2027\\u202fitems\\u202fkm−2, 0.13\\u202f±\\u202f0.08\\u202fitems\\u202fm−2, 20,274\\u202f±\\u202f15,873\\u202fitems\\u202fkm−2 and 36,455\\u202f±\\u202f33,935\\u202fitems\\u202fkm−2, respectively. Based on the Clean Coast Indexes, the beaches investigated were supposed to be “very clean” most of the time (73.2%\\u202f±\\u202f34.9%). Wastes with low value for recycling/reuse, such as grocery bags, ropes, and foams, were the main items of marine debris in the study area. Both domestic sources from the upstream and local fishing/aquaculture activities significantly contributed to marine debris. Obvious regional differences in benthic debris categories could be explained by both natural factors and the rural-urban gap in economic levels, waste-management strategies and infrastructure. These might be common features in this emerging market and densely populated economy. The findings provide insights into the sources of mismanaged waste around this tourist city and some neglected deficiencies in China's current solid waste management system.\",\n",

The successful synthesis of few-walled CNTs in the system relies on the catalytic processing of pyrolysis gas from plastics into intermediate gas mixtures containing mainly paraffins and hydrogen (700 °C, catalyst: 40 wt% Co, 10 wt% Mo and 50 wt% MgO). Under appropriate conditions (1000 °C, catalyst: Co 3 wt%, Mo 2 wt% and MgO 95 wt%, synthesis time: 20 min), the obtained intermediate gas mixture was selectively converted into few-walled CNTs with > 95% CNTs having small outer diameters of 1–7 nm, containing CNTs with as little as three walls and having distinct radial breathing mode in Raman spectra at wave lengths 100–400 cm−1.

Such a process was found to improve the climate change impacts of the waste management system by 75% and the non-renewable resource depletion impacts by 18%. A preliminary financial assessment suggests that the value of the plastics recovered in this way would be less than the reduction in electricity income for the EfW leading to a loss of £2-5 million per year. However, if the plastics were separated by householders for a kerbside recycling scheme, the higher price commanded by the higher-quality reclaimed plastics and lower processing costs means that overall the operation would be financially viable giving a net present value of £768 000 at a 5% rate of return. In both cases, there is a further financial benefit to the EfW operator resulting from the additional gate fees for processing waste to replace the plastics removed. Further work is required to assess the costs and effectiveness of using both kerbside collections and mechanical recovery to reduce the plastics content and carbon intensity of EfW feeds.',\n",

       " {'context': '               Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common polyester polymer that constitutes a hefty fraction of plastics demand worldwide. This is due to its versatility and multipurpose usage, which results in large quantities of it ending up in plastic solid waste (PSW). Luckily, PET is a thermoplastic that can soften once heated and recycled. However, PET reinforced with nanomaterials and other types of polymers are much difficult to handle and can lead to unit poisoning and malfunctioning once processed through thermochemical reactors in industry. This work gives an overview of PET and its manufacturing process that led to such a large amount of R&D projects devoted to its study, especially its thermal behavior. We shall focus on the thermal degradation of PET when blended with other materials, in order to understand its reaction kinetics and estimate the main kinetic parameters after developing a sound mathematical model that can explain its behavior under heat in inert atmospheres (i.e., pyrolysis). Two case studies illustrated in this chapter are devoted to this purpose. The first is the study of PET blends with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); while the second focuses on polybutylene terephthalate (PBT, another common polyester) blends with nanoclay (NC) and carbon nanofiber (CNF). Degradation kinetics were modeled in both cases and the preexponential (A                  o), activation energy (E                  a), and reaction order (n) were estimated. Such work can give way to developing unit operations and understating the behavior of mentioned polymers under certain thermal conditions for petroleum downstream integration and recycling purposes.

The excellent performance on the removal of HCN and the enhanced H2-rich syngas production is due to the synergy between Ni, Mg, and Al in the catalysts.

       " {'context': 'The study of the catalytic pyrolysis of mixtures of fuel and polymers is interesting in order to explore the possibility of using commercial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units or similar processes for recycling plastic wastes. In this work, different samples of vacuum gas oil (VGO), polyethylene (PE) and vacuum gas oil–polyethylene blends (VGO–PE) have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis. Vacuum gas oil–polyethylene blends with 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% w/w of PE were prepared by continuously stirring for 120min, at 60rpm at 120°C, and afterwards, the effect of different catalysts (HZSM-5, HUSY, HBeta zeolites, FCC catalysts and Al-MCM-41) on the decomposition of these mixtures was studied. Moreover, the deposition of coke over each catalyst was studied by thermogravimetric analysis in an oxidant atmosphere. The catalytic pyrolysis behaviour of the VGO–PE mixtures indicates a two-step process, the degradation of the VGO and the PE fraction being almost independent. The degradation or evaporation of the VGO fraction is only slightly affected by the presence of the catalyst, whereas the PE fraction showed similar behaviour as that already described in the literature for the pure polymer. The results show that the HBeta zeolite is the most active catalyst for the decomposition of the mixtures, and that the ZSM-5 zeolite is the catalyst with the lowest amount of coke formation. These results are in very good agreement with the structural characteristics of the different catalysts studied, i.e., with their pore size and acidity.',\n",

       " {'context': 'At present, waste mobile phone is considered to be one of the fastest-growing obsolete items in the stream of electronic waste (e-waste). Toxic substances such as heavy metals and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been widely added to plastics used in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The recent technological revolution in electronic appliances combined with high and growing consumption has caused a huge generation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Therefore, e-waste plastics are considered to be one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. In this study, we examined the hazardous substances in the plastic components of waste mobile phones and then applied the USEtox life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) model to determine the impacts on human health. Specifically, various plastic parts separated from waste mobile phones (n = 20) were collected and then, we used standard tests to characterize the heavy metals and brominated flame retardants. The mean and range of the results are 2207.7 μg/kg (503.9–11569.9 μg/kg) for Pb, 91.6 μg/kg (8.8–464.4 μg/kg) for Cd, 13.7 μg/kg (1.6–58.9 μg/kg) for Be, 7203.3 μg/kg (117–69813 μg/kg) for Sb, 471.3 μg/kg (143.4–2351.3 μg/kg) for As, 1.5 mg/kg (2.1–12.5 mg/kg) for Hg and 523.7 mg/kg (27.1–3859 mg/kg) for Cr. The BFRs - a sum Polybrominated Biphenyls, Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers and Hexabromocyclododecane - were not detected except for two samples, which was an average of 234.5 μg/kg for nona-BDE and deca-BDE. The total bromine (Br) concentration varied from 0 to 471 mg/kg (average value of 87.9 mg/kg) , while Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A) showed an average concentration of 214.3 μg/kg. In the case of potential human health risks, Hg contributed the major risk for carcinogens and non-cancer disease in the plastics, but the contribution of Pb was also significant. In the case of eco-toxicity, Cr posed the most significant risks in the plastics. Overall, the results show that the toxic substances are below the limit values of substances regulated in the RoHS Directive in China and Europe. However, the results of LCIA highlight the growing importance to avoid the open burning practices of e-waste plastics that contain Hg, Pb, Cr ad Sb. Additionally, the results set a new database for the e-waste plastics recycling industry and provide information for ecodesign in EEE production.',\n",

However, the development of cost-effective and compressible green aerogel is still a great challenge and a research hotspot. In this work, a novel hydrophobic konjac glucomannan/corn stalk fibers (KGM/CSFs) aerogel with porous three-dimensional structure featured low density, high porosity, good compressibility and hydrophobicity (146°) were prepared and used to selectively remove different organic liquids from oil/water mixtures. The effects of the amount of corn stalk fibers (CSFs) on the physical properties such as density, porosity and mechanical properties of the aerogel were investigated in detail. The obtained hydrophobic KGM/CSFs aerogel exhibited high absorption capacity (24.76 g/g-58.07 g/g) for various organic liquids. After 10 cycles, the adsorption capacity of the aerogel for chloroform and diesel remained above 90% of the initial adsorption capacity, showing excellent reusability. More importantly, the oils or organic solvents could be selectively absorbed by the hydrophobic KGM/CSFs aerogel from oil/water mixtures with a separation efficiency of over 99.38%. Considering the advantages of eco-friendliness, low cost and simple preparation process, the hydrophobic biomass-based aerogel prepared from waste corn stalks can be used as a promising absorbent for efficient and selective absorption of oils or organic solvents.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polymers are the most versatile material in our modern day and age. With certain chemicals and additives (pigments, concentrates, anti-blockers, light transformers (LTs), UV-stabilizers, etc.), they become what we know as plastics. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an in depth analysis regarding the recovery, treatment and recycling routes of plastic solid waste (PSW), as well as the main advantages and disadvantages associated with every route. Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-α-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste. Nevertheless, due to their high calorific value and embodied energy, plastics are being incinerated solely or in combination with municipal solid waste (MSW) in many developed countries. This review also presents a number of application and technologies currently being used to incinerate plastics. Cement kilns and fluidized beds are the two most common units used to recover energy from PSW or MSW with high PSW content. It is concluded that, tertiary (chemical methods) and quaternary (energy recovery) are robust enough to be investigated and researched in the near future, for they provide a very sustainable solution to the PSW cycle.',\n",

Plastic liquefaction producing liquid hydrocarbons is an effective way to dispose waste plastics in an eco-friendly manner. In present study, high quality liquid fuel is produced from waste plastics via two-step bottom-up cracking approach. A comparative analysis of liquid products obtained in thermal and catalytic cracking performed at relatively lower temperature (350 °C) with minimal catalyst to plastic feed ratio (1:30) has been studied. Catalytic cracking via two-step bottom-up route provides higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons in comparison to the thermal cracking. Catalytic cracking is performed using two different catalysts; HZSM-5 and 5%Fe/HZSM-5 in which later results in higher liquid yield (76 wt%) than former (60 wt%) having comparable fuel characteristics. GC–MS results confirm that liquid product obtained via catalytic cracking contains higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons (C6-C20); 66.39% for 5%Fe/HZSM-5 and 47.33% for HZSM-5 which is comparatively higher than that obtained in thermal cracking (27.39%). FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies confirm that liquid hydrocarbons obtained via catalytic cracking have comparable chemical characteristics with fuel range hydrocarbons. Physiochemical properties of catalysts are studied using XRD, XPS, BET, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, NH3-TPD and H2-TPR techniques and correlated with activity results. Analysis of commercial diesel fuel is also incorporated to compare the fuel characteristics of liquid products.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A life cycle assessment was carried out to investigate the environmental benefits of removing dense plastics from household waste before burning the waste in an energy from waste (EfW) facility. Such a process was found to improve the climate change impacts of the waste management system by 75% and the non-renewable resource depletion impacts by 18%. A preliminary financial assessment suggests that the value of the plastics recovered in this way would be less than the reduction in electricity income for the EfW leading to a loss of £2-5 million per year. However, if the plastics were separated by householders for a kerbside recycling scheme, the higher price commanded by the higher-quality reclaimed plastics and lower processing costs means that overall the operation would be financially viable giving a net present value of £768 000 at a 5% rate of return. In both cases, there is a further financial benefit to the EfW operator resulting from the additional gate fees for processing waste to replace the plastics removed. Further work is required to assess the costs and effectiveness of using both kerbside collections and mechanical recovery to reduce the plastics content and carbon intensity of EfW feeds.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The study of the catalytic pyrolysis of mixtures of fuel and polymers is interesting in order to explore the possibility of using commercial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units or similar processes for recycling plastic wastes. In this work, different samples of vacuum gas oil (VGO), polyethylene (PE) and vacuum gas oil–polyethylene blends (VGO–PE) have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis. Vacuum gas oil–polyethylene blends with 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% w/w of PE were prepared by continuously stirring for 120min, at 60rpm at 120°C, and afterwards, the effect of different catalysts (HZSM-5, HUSY, HBeta zeolites, FCC catalysts and Al-MCM-41) on the decomposition of these mixtures was studied. Moreover, the deposition of coke over each catalyst was studied by thermogravimetric analysis in an oxidant atmosphere. The catalytic pyrolysis behaviour of the VGO–PE mixtures indicates a two-step process, the degradation of the VGO and the PE fraction being almost independent. The degradation or evaporation of the VGO fraction is only slightly affected by the presence of the catalyst, whereas the PE fraction showed similar behaviour as that already described in the literature for the pure polymer. The results show that the HBeta zeolite is the most active catalyst for the decomposition of the mixtures, and that the ZSM-5 zeolite is the catalyst with the lowest amount of coke formation. These results are in very good agreement with the structural characteristics of the different catalysts studied, i.e., with their pore size and acidity.',\n",

This hazardous waste is mainly composed of oxide iron, such as hematite, magnetite and wustite.

In this work, the catalytic potential of mill scale (MS) from a steel plant was evaluated for hexavalent chromium reduction from synthetic and real matrices under slurry conditions (MS particles dispersed in the solution) or immobilized in Raschig rings. Experiments were conducted in an annular photoreactor irradiated by UVA light. Raschig rings were coated with MS by electrostatic link with polyethylene-grafted-maleic anhydride copolymer (PEGMA) film, and further packed in the annular zone of the UV photoreactor. SEM, XRD and FTIR analysis showed a homogeneous film of MS firmly attached on Raschig rings surface. In this way, the iron-rich industrial steel waste acted as both source of iron and photocatalyst, allowing the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the bulk solution and MS surface, respectively, in the presence of tartaric acid as hole and hydroxyl scavenger and Fe-complexing agent. The Raschig rings (248 g) coated with MS (23 g) achieved total Cr(VI) reduction (below detection limit) after 45 min of reaction (k = 2.0 × 10−2 mg L−1 min− 1) under UVA radiation, considering the following initial conditions: [Cr(VI)]0 = 10 mg L−1, [tartaric acid]0/[Cr(VI)]0 molar ratio = 6:1, pH = 3.0, T = 25 °C. The same system was tested for the treatment of a real effluent from a galvanic industry containing 6 mg L−1 of Cr(VI). Using the same tartaric acid/Cr(VI) molar ratio (6:1) and pH 3.0, the Cr(VI) present in the effluent was totally reduced (below detection limit) in 360 min (k = 1.93 × 10−2 mg L− 1 min− 1), showing similar kinetic behavior as the process with the synthetic matrix. In all experiments, the concentrations of dissolved iron (Fe(II) and Fe(total)) were below the disposal limit established by Brazilian legislation, and total chromium removal was achieved by Cr(III) precipitation after the photocatalytic reaction.',\n",

In this opinion article, we discuss the benefits of biodegradable plastics in combination with appropriate disposal systems. We argue that the most beneficial environmental value of biodegradable plastics is in the areas of packaging, single-use items, and agricultural plastic mulches. While biodegradable plastics need to be an integral component of strategies to minimize plastic pollution of the environment, they have to be used and managed with specific end-of-life scenarios. Disposal in the environment, except for agricultural plastic mulches, must never be an end-of-life option.

However, most of the techniques used by researchers in this area are inadequate to provide evidence of the final stage: assimilation. In this review, we describe the different stages of biodegradation and we state several techniques used by some authors working in this domain. Validate assimilation (including mineralization) is an important aspect to guarantee the real biodegradability of items of consumption (in particular friendly environmental new materials). Since LDPE is considered to be practically inert, efforts were made to isolate unique microorganisms capable of utilizing LDPEs. Recent data showed that biodegradation of LDPE waste with selected microbial strains became a viable solution. Among biological agents, microbial enzymes are one of the most powerful tools for the biodegradation of LDPEs. Activity of biodegradation of most enzymes is higher in fungi than in bacteria. It is important to consider fungal degradation of LDPE in order to understand what is necessary for biodegradation and the mechanisms involved. This requires understanding of the interactions between materials and microorganisms and the biochemical changes involved. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of LDPEs have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with LDPE waste. This paper reviews the current research on the biodegradation of LDPEs and also use of various techniques for the analysis of degradation in vitro.',\n",

The aim of the present study is the investigation of the impact of toner composition, printing processes and pulping conditions on the deinking of office waste paper through the flotation process. Deinking of papers printed by 21 different copiers and laser printers was tested under mild-conditions. It was attested that both the toner and the printing machine play an important role in the deinkability. The deinking efficiency varied significantly across different cases, spanning from low values (<100 mm2 specks surface per m2 deinked paper surface) to high values (>1,000 mm2 specks surface per m2 recycled paper surface). It was proved that the presence of styrene-acrylate copolymers and iron oxides in the toner resulted in reduced deinkability. In addition, slow printing speed had also a negative impact on the deinking efficiency. According to the research conducted, the removal of particles larger than 150 μm is a decisive factor in the deinking process. It was also demonstrated that the deinkability of office waste paper highly depends on the pulping conditions i.e. temperature, time and consistency. In particular, the highest deinkability was recorded when the three factors had simultaneously the highest values. Under these conditions, approximately 98% decrease in the total specks surface was achieved by flotation. The most important factor was the repulping consistency and the less important the temperature. More specifically, by increasing only the temperature, a reduction equal to 95.4% of specks surface was achieved, while by increasing only the consistency, 96.4% reduction of specks surface was achieved after the flotation process. In general, the intensity of repulping conditions resulted in decreasing toners’ specks size and therefore in increased deinking efficiency.',\n",

Recycling silicon kerf is of increasing interest, focusing on various applications such as batteries, heat exchangers, color glasses etc. In this work, the case of thermoelectric material production is proposed and explored. Slurry waste from cutting Si wafers was processed, aiming to obtain powders with high Si concentration for the preparation of thermoelectric silicides. Mg2Si1-x-ySnxGey based materials were prepared using processed Si-kerf and their properties were evaluated. Structural features, as well as thermoelectric performance of the silicides are presented and compared to previously synthesized materials using a high purity Si source. A quite high figure-of-merit value of these multiphase materials was achieved, reaching up to 1.3 for the Sn-rich and 1 for the Si-rich compositions at 800\\u202fK.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Agricultural plastics are currently characterised by a predominantly linear take-make-dispose value chain, thus being a major stream of waste that contributes to significant environmental and economic issues. Therefore, policy makers have recently indicated the adoption of circular economy approaches as the way forward for plastics. This study addresses the problem of agricultural plastic waste as a major stream of landfilled waste by assessing the potential for recycling the plastic into higher value products through pyrolysis and by optimally designing the respective supply network to support this process. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to optimise the end-to-end supply network design, from the waste generation stage up to the end consumer of the produced material. The model is supported by experimental results on the pyrolysis performance for contaminated plastic samples. The model is applied in a case study of the Scottish agricultural sector to showcase its potential in assessing the feasibility and financial viability in addition to the positive environmental impact on agricultural plastic waste supply networks. The results demonstrate the potential of using the pyrolysis technology for agricultural plastic waste recycling as an example of a circular economy approach and the benefits of using the developed model for decision making purposes, as well as the potential for waste reduction and the implications for farmers' operations.\",\n",

The effects of the carbonization temperature and H3PO4 impregnation ratio on the product distributions were studied. Increasing the H3PO4 impregnation ratio (0–2.0) and carbonization temperature (600–750 °C) was found to enhance the selectivity of aromatics. When the activated carbon was synthesized using an H3PO4 impregnation ratio of 1:1 and a carbonization temperature of 700 °C, the yield of aromatics reached a maximum of 86.11% and the selectivity of mono-aromatics reached 64.01%. Moreover, the catalytic performances of biochars obtained at various carbonization temperatures were also studied. No significant catalytic activity of biochar for the formation of aromatics was observed due to the absence of P-containing active functional groups.

Conventional waste management methods involve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and limited resource recovery, thus necessitating advanced techniques to convert such wastes into bioenergy, bio-fertilizers and valuable-added products. Research and application experiences from different scale applications indicate that the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) process is a kind of high-rate anaerobic digester for urban organic wastes valorization including food waste and waste sludge, while the research status is still insufficiently summarized. Through compiling recent achievements and literature, this review will focus on the following aspects, including AnMBR treatment performance and membrane fouling, technical limitations, energy balance and techno-economic assessment as well as future perspectives. AnMBR can enhance organic wastes treatment via complete retention of functional microbes and suspended solids, and timely separation of products and potential inhibitory substances, thus improving digestion efficiency in terms of increased organics degradation rates, biogas production and process robustness at a low footprint. When handling high-solid organic wastes, membrane fouling and mass transfer issues can be the challenges limiting AnMBR applications to a wet-type digestion, thus countermeasures are required to pursue extended implementations. A conceptual framework is proposed by taking various organic wastes disposal and final productions (permeate, biogas and biosolids) utilization into consideration, which will contribute to the development of AnMBR-based waste-to-resource facilities towards sustainable waste management and more economic-environmental benefits output.',\n",

We assessed the environmental impacts of waste recycling in Kampala City, for four designed waste management scenarios, namely: (1) Scenario S1 representing the current status quo, (2) Scenario S2 maximizing landfill, (3) Scenario S3 combining composting, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage, and (4) Scenario S4 integrating anaerobic digestion, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage. These scenarios are quantitatively assessed for environmental impacts of global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment, photochemical ozone formation, water pollution and resource conservation. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the robustness for the ranking of the scenarios. Scenario S4 integrating anaerobic digestion, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage performs best for all environmental impact categories. Sensitivity analysis shows that this assessment result is robust. Therefore, integrating waste recycling into the formal waste management system for Kampala would considerably reduce the environmental impacts of waste flows. Also, considering the similarities in municipal solid waste compositions, sanitation systems and settlement patterns among the large cities in East Africa, assimilating waste recycling into the formal waste management systems for these cities would results in minimal environmental impacts for their waste flows.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Titanium white waste acid (TWWA) is strongly acidic, and has high metatitanic acid (TiO(OH)2) and n-hexane (C6H14) content. In this study, the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the modification of TWWA deacidification were evaluated via pilot testing. The results showed that the PVA solution can significantly improve the deacidification performance of TWWA. The TWWA specific resistance to filtration (SRF) decreased from the initial 2.42\\u202f×\\u202f1013\\u202fm/kg to 1.80\\u202f×\\u202f1012\\u202fm/kg when 2% PVA solution was added at 25% (v/v). Furthermore, the amount of filter press-processed TWWA increased by 3.56\\u202fm3 relative to the control, and the moisture content of titanium white slag was only 42.02% after deacidification. In addition, distillation and phase separation was demonstrated to efficiently separate C6H14 and hydrochloric acid (HCl) from the mixed filtrate. Moreover, titanium white slag was converted into rutile after 60\\u202fmin when the calcination temperature was 900\\u202f°C, with the titanium dioxide (TiO2) purity of rutile reaching 91.83%. Accordingly, the TWWA recycling process proceeded as follows: PVA modification, solid-liquid separation, filtrate distillation and phase separation, and titanium white slag calcination. Our findings demonstrate that this process has unique practical application value.',\n",

A typical composition of the main plastics found in municipal solid waste was prepared using 33% HDPE, 5% LDPE, 10% PP, 21% PET, 24.8% PS, 5.2% PVC, 1% cellulose and also a 0.5% waste vegetable oil was added. The wastes were added to the coal blends in the proportions of 1%, 2% and 3% for plastics and 0.5% for vegetable oil. Two types of experiments were performed. The first was carried out in a hearth heating furnace (HHF) at temperatures of up to 900°C for a 7 h period. The second was a box test, which consists of heating coal blends in 18L cans using a pilot coking oven, for approximately 20 h at temperatures between 1050 and 1100°C. The quality parameters used for the assessment were the CSR (coke strength after reaction), CRI (coke reactivity index), ash, volatile matter and sulfur in order to identify the effect of plastic and vegetable oil on coke quality. Results for CSR in the HHF averaged 52.3%, and 56.63% in box test trials. The CRI results ranged from 26.6% to 35.7%. Among the different percentages of plastics used, 3% plastic blends provided the most stable CSR results. The industrial furnaces work at temperatures between 1100 and 1350°C and time coking 21–24h, compared to the test conditions achieved in the HHF and pilot furnace with box test. It was concluded that the results of CSR and CRI are consistent with the tests confirming the feasibility of using plastic in the steelmaking process.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Although using polymeric waste as a substitution for stone aggregate in concrete can greatly contribute to diminishing environmental issues, it leads to the degradation of many mechanical features of concrete. To approach this issue, using upgraded waste granules can improve these degraded features. Therefore, for the first time in this work, through hot-compacting nylon waste, the compressive stress–strain performance of fiber-reinforced concrete incorporating upgraded nylon waste was assessed before and after heating. To do this, 81 concrete samples were made and subjected to the axial compressive test, with test variables of the volume of the upgraded nylon waste (0, 10, and 20%) substituting for sand, the volume fraction of steel fibers (0, 0.75, and 1.25%), and the heating temperature (20, 300, and 600 °C). Then, parameters contributing to the compressive behavior of concrete including the compressive strength, strain at peak stress, elastic modulus, ultimate strain, toughness index, and stress–strain graph were evaluated, the surface appearance and failure mode were examined, microstructural observations were conducted, and prediction models of the mechanical features were proposed. Moreover, the residual compressive strength values were assessed versus the estimations of the ACI 216, EN 1994–1-2, and ASCE codes. The results demonstrated that by raising the heat, notable degradation occurred in the mechanical features of the concretes, and the greatest drops occurred after 600 °C, such that compressive strength and elastic modulus on average dropped by 61 and 84%, respectively, and the ultimate strain increased by 2–9 folds. Further, adding nylon granules to the concrete mixtures lowered the mechanical features of the samples while introducing steel fibers improved them. Afterward, two stress–strain models were proposed to capture the post-heating compressive behavior of concrete. These models demonstrated proper agreement with the experimental results. Finally, the response surface method (RSM) was employed to present an optimum solution for the design parameters by maximizing the compressive strength and toughness index of concrete.',\n",

Furthermore, the study estimates potential environmental impacts from recycling in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Findings suggest that hotels should practice recycling more rigorously not only to help the environment, but also to realize some potential monetary benefits.

Various volume fractions of sand 3%, 10%, 20% and 50% are replaced by the same volume of plastic. This paper investigates the physical and mechanical properties of the obtained composites. The main results of this study show the feasibility of the reuse of PC and PET waste aggregates materials as partial volume substitutes for natural aggregates in cementitious materials. Despite of some drawbacks like a decrease in compressive strength, the use of PC and PET waste aggregates presents various advantages. A reduction of the specific weight of the cementitious materials and a significant improvement of their post-peak flexural behaviour are observed. The calculated flexural toughness factors increase significantly with increasing volume fraction of PET and PC-aggregates. Thus, addition of PC and PET plastic aggregates in cementitious materials seems to give good energy absorbing materials which is very interesting for several civil engineering applications like structures subjected to dynamic or impact efforts. The present study has shown quite encouraging results and opened new way for the recycling of PC waste aggregate in cement and concrete composites.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Different amounts of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were added to a bituminous coal used to produce metallurgical coke. The effect of the plastic waste on the carbonization process and more exactly, on the coking pressure were investigated. A movable wall oven at semi-pilot scale was used for measuring coking pressure generated. It was found that coking pressure increases for low LDPE addition levels (1–3wt.%); however higher amounts of LDPE reduce coking pressure. To explain this behavior different blends of the coal and the residue were pyrolysed at three different temperatures (450, 500 and 600°C) in a Gray-King apparatus. The results show that LDPE causes a modification in the pyrolysis process and also influences the swelling process of the plastic stage. The increase of the coking pressure at low LDPE addition rates is associated with a less permeable coal plastic layer, which prevents the removal of the decomposition products and causes their retention in the semicoke matrix, evolving them in the post-plastic stage. Coking pressure decrease at high LDPE addition rates can be due to the charge shrinkage and the better permeability to the migration of oil components, which suggest a lower interaction between the coal and the LDPE. A delay in the degradation of LDPE is confirmed by the data provided by DRIFT and SEM.',\n",

Herein, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics over seven types of commercial and home-made activated carbons was studied in a facile tube reactor. A central composite experimental design was further adapted to optimize the reaction conditions and up to 100 area% of the obtained liquid components belonged to jet fuel-ranged hydrocarbons, in which alkanes and aromatics accounted for 71.8% and 28.2%, respectively. Experiment results revealed that these activated carbons although generated via various physical and chemical activation processes could all exhibited excellent catalytic performance in converting low-density polyethylene into jet fuel and H2-enriched gases. Properties of activated carbons were also characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, nitrogen gas adsorption, and chemical adsorption. It can be concluded that the acidity was a critical factor in determining the catalyst activity, where jet fuel-ranged alkanes and aromatics were favored by using activated carbons of weak and relevant strong acidity, respectively. Rising catalytic reaction temperature could enhance the aromatization of alkanes to increase the percentage of aromatics and release more hydrogen molecules. In addition, the production of jet fuel was also achieved from daily waste plastics, which was also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The present work offers a novel route of converting waste plastics directly into transportation jet fuel.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study aims to advocate for the acknowledgment of the services of invisible hands that do pro-environmental work, despite living in post-conflict trauma themselves. These “accidental sustainopreneurs” earn a living while helping societies become more sustainable. Their work for both upstream manufacturers and downstream consumers serves as a stepping stone toward the introduction of cleaner production across waste value chains in developing countries. They have positive effects on multiple recycling sectors, and their transition to formal, integrated solid waste management is the objective of this study. Inductive qualitative research design is employed to examine how these entrepreneurial agents work in unpredicted ways to create value for society while being stigmatized by focusing specifically on the case of waste picker sustainopreneurs registered with the Water and Sanitation Services in Pakistan (WSSP). The findings of this study suggested that a whopping 99% majority of such workers pretend as if none of their kind exist, possess dual identities, and are stigmatized due to refugee backgrounds. Using the social construction of stigma lens, their identities have been stigmatized amidst their burden of complementing the work of local MSWM authorities. In addition, the findings regarding unpredictable weather patterns, lack of assets, seasonal shocks, uncertain policies, rules of business, and the exploitative subletting of waster picker jurisdictions are reported. This study provides a more thorough understanding of their self-organized work context, an understanding of policies, and the higher survival skills and immunity levels of these workers, even in the absence of safety equipment and measures. This study demonstrates how self-organizing, low-tech, informal solutions can act as a foundation toward cleaner productions and environmental sustainability.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In this study, fragments of polyethylene plastic bags were treated with simulated gastric juice of fish for 16 h. Following solid-phase extraction, methanol eluents caused acute toxicity to embryos and larvae of Japanese medaka. Chromatographic fractions (polar to more non-polar with numbers increasing) of the extract were evaluated for toxicity and estrogenic activity using medaka and an estrogen receptor (ER) cell-line. Fractions 6 and 9 had the highest estrogenic effects with relative hydrophobic chemicals. The vtg expression in fraction 6 was 22-fold higher than control, and the ER cellular response in fraction 9 was 8.5-fold higher than controls. Following non-target screening (NTS), several novel phthalates and phenols were identified in the above two fractions. Fractions 1 and 2 appeared to be primarily responsible for the acute toxicity observed with the whole extract. The hatching rate decreased to 36 % in fraction 2, and was not observed following exposure to fraction 1. NTS of these fractions indicated 635 and 808 entities, respectively, most without toxicity information. These results indicate plastic leachates from gastric juices of fish are complex mixtures of many compounds that can have acute reproductive and sublethal endocrine impacts in fish.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Lightweight soil technology has been widely used in construction projects to solve soft ground problems. Previous work, however, has shown that the maximum interior temperature of field test bodies reaches to about 90°C. On the other hand, industrial waste disposal is an increasing problem. PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste is now generated in vast quantities to increased consumption of drinking water sold in PET bottles. Making effective use of PET waste as a ground material may help solve the problem of its disposal. This paper describes the effects of initial high temperature curing on unconfined compressive strength and the microstructure of foamed mixture lightweight soil containing PET flake. Increase in PET-cement ratio lessened the decrease in unconfined compressive strength with increasing initial temperature. This property makes PET flake useful as a construction material. However, unconfined compressive strength decreases with increasing initial temperature at all PET-cement ratios. Observations show that the microstructure of foamed mixture lightweight soil containing PET flake have noticeable cracks if samples are cured at 90°C for 1 day; the PET flake is not completely combined with the matrix. The formation of this microstructure is the main factor of the remarkable strength decrease based on initial high temperature curing.',\n",

Adsorption of As under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against changing pH (4–8), contact time (0–40 min) and a dose of char (0.5–1.5 g). The uptake capability was found to be in the range of 10.7–99.4 %. Amongst all the plastic chars used, PE and PVC mixed char showed the highest removal of As that ranged from 71.6–99.4%. Least amount of sorption was shown by PE and PET chars which was found to be in range of 12.4–32.5%. The optimum equilibrium time of 20 min with acidic medium (pH 6.0) at 1.5 g was the best-favored dose for 99.4 % adsorption of As. Pseudo-Second-Order rate effectively fitted well with removal kinetics, whereas Langmuir isotherm models fitted more accurately to the obtained results.

Thanks to a combination of low-cost, ease of manufacturing and processing, excellent physical and chemical properties combined with adequate mechanical properties for structural applications, a tremendous and continuous increase in the consumption of polymer materials has occurred worldwide. However, the flip side of this ever-increasing consumption is the huge amount of waste, leading to deleterious environmental, health and economic impacts. Besides the use of recycled plastics, another important factor contributes to a material-efficient approach in the manufacturing industry; it is the mechanical design for 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), where minimum material usage complying with lightweight, stiffness and strength requirements is pursued by topology optimization. In this technical and economical international scenario, the present paper presents a bibliographic survey concerning the structural durability of additively manufactured recycled plastics and compounds. In particular, the paper is aimed at investigating the structural durability of three “families” of recycled plastics (rPlastic), i.e. rABS, rPP and rPP/glass fiber compound. Therefore, a literature survey regarding the considered materials will be presented by focusing on the influence of the 3D-printing process parameters on their mechanical and fatigue properties. Finally, a comparison between the results found in the literature of 3D-printed and traditionally manufactured polymers will be reported.',\n",

In this study, which was inspired by the structures of orange and pomegranate, a facile strategy via a self-template method was adopted to prepare form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs) for the first time. Utilising poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spherulite crystals as templates, the cross-linked polymer (named CPA) was prepared as a supporting material by in situ polyaddition. The bionic vesicle structure microstructures were investigated by parallel optical stereo microscope and scanning electron microscope. The results suggest that a vesicle-like structure is formed in the prepared PEG/CPA FSPCMs. Compared with the FSPCMs prepared by interpenetrating cross-linked network method, the FSPCMs prepared by self-template method has higher PEG loading value. Especially, when PEG-20K (the molecular weight is 20 K) with a larger spherulite diameter was used as a template to prepare PEG-20K/CPA FSPCMs, the loading value was as high as 900%. Moreover, in a process attributed to the regeneration of various types of hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and transesterification, the recyclable CPA enables the PEG-20K/CPA (9/1) FSPCMs to possess good thermally reversible reusability.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effects of size and shape of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) aggregate on the fresh and hardened properties, including abrasion resistance, of concrete. 5%, 10% and 15% in volume of natural aggregate in the concrete mixes were replaced by an equal volume of three differently shaped and sized PET-aggregates. The results indicate that the slump of fresh concrete increases slightly with the incorporation of pellet-shaped PET-aggregate. Flakier plastic aggregate sharply decreases the slump of the fresh concrete and it further decreases if the content and size of this type of PET-aggregate increase. The compressive strength, tensile splitting strength, modulus of elasticity and flexural strength of concrete deteriorate due to the incorporation of PET-aggregate and the deterioration of these properties intensifies with increasing content of this aggregate. Differences in size, shape and texture of PET-aggregates change the water to cement ratio as well as the slump of fresh concrete mixes, which ultimately change the mechanical behaviour. Flaky PET-aggregates bridge the two separated concrete pieces and therefore prevent concrete from breaking apart after failure. The abrasion resistance of concrete mixes containing various types of PET-aggregate is better than that of the reference concrete. The abrasion resistance of concrete with incorporation of various types and contents of PET-aggregates can be related to its compressive strength.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyethylene microparticles are common contaminants in the marine environment, which are easily ingested by fish and can provoke physical damage or toxic reactions, resulting in inflammation, stress-related alterations and behavioural disorders. This work focuses on the extend of the alterations by microplastic ingestion on the intestinal health of Sparus aurata, in an integrative effort to relate the effect on gut microbiota and histopathological damage. Virgin, low density, polyethylene microplastic (LDPE-MP) particles were included into a control diet (D1, without MP), at a 0.12% in two different size ranges in diet D2 (200–500 μm) and D3 (501–1000 μm). Gilthead sea bream were fed D1, D2 or D3 diets for 30 days, and then sacrificed, biometrical data recorded, anterior intestine samples taken for histological analyses and anterior intestine mucus collected for Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA, to evaluate the adherent bacterial communities. Intestines of fish fed D2 and D3 contained plastic aggregates and showed macroscopic signs of distension, liquid accumulation and inflammation. Their histopathological analysis revealed severe mechanical lesions (haemorrhages and epithelial desquamation and necrosis), inflammatory reaction (eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, and melanomacrophage presence) and severe epithelial vacuolization, caused by erosion and accumulation of MPs with sharp and rough-edges. Illumina sequencing resulted in over 7 million high-quality reads that were assigned to 589 OTUs. No significant differences were found in richness, diversity or composition at the phylum level among all three experimental groups. However, small but significant differences were found in differential expression analyses, with the D2 diet changing 6.2% and D3 changing 2.9% of the total bacterial composition in anterior intestine. The altered microbial composition seems to be directed as an attempt to counteract the mechanical damage and inflammation inflicted by MPs ingestion, in agreement with metagenome prediction and pathway analysis, which revealed that the slight effect of diets containing MPs (D2 and D3) on gut microbiota has the potential to change the metabolic capacity of these populations, including a decrease in pathways related to bacterial infection and inflammation. Thus, virgin LDPE-MPs ingestion in gilthead sea bream did not significantly affect growth and gut microbiota composition over a 30-day feeding period, but the slight alterations observed could derive in growth problems and dysbiosis upon prolonged microplastic ingestion, which are mainly driven by the severe mechanical damage inflicted to the digestive tract.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The stress responses of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge to polyethylene (PE) microplastic exposure were revealed for the first time. In this study, a lab-scale sulfate-reducing up-flow sludge bed reactor was continuously operated with different concentrations of PE microplastics in the feed (20, 100, and 500 microplastic particles (MPs)/L). Exposure to low levels of PE microplastics (i.e., 20 MPs/L) had a limited effect on SRB consortia, whereas higher levels of PE microplastics imposed apparent physiological stresses on SRB consortia. Despite this, the overall reactor performance, i.e., chemical oxygen demand removal and sulfate conversion, was less affected by prolonged exposure to PE microplastics. Moreover, as the concentration of PE microplastics increased, the SRB consortia promoted the production of extracellular polymeric substances to a greater extent, especially the secretion of proteins. As a result, protective effects against the cytotoxicity of PE microplastics were provided. Batch experiments further demonstrated that leaching additives from PE microplastics (including acetyl tri-n‑butyl citrate and bisphenol A, concentrations up to 5 μg/g sludge) exerted only a minor effect on the activity of SRB consortia. Additionally, microbial community analysis revealed active and potentially efficient sulfate reducers at different operational stages. Our results provide insight into the stress responses of SRB sludge under PE microplastic exposure and suggested that SRB consortia can gradually adapt to and resist high levels of PE microplastics. These findings may promote a better understanding of the stable operation of SRB sludge systems under specific environmental stimuli for practical applications.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Over the past decade communities and municipalities have been increasingly switching their recycling systems from dual stream (DS) to single stream (SS). Accordingly, material recovery facilities (MRF) have been constructed and retrofitted in order to accommodate fully commingled input streams. This transition has been driven by a variety of factors, including a general understanding that SS tends to result in increased waste diversion rates for participating communities. This paper examines the greenhouse gas emissions, or “carbon footprint,” of recycling systems before and after the transition from DS to SS. This investigation aims to assess the environmental impact of trends in the recycling industry from a holistic perspective. In our analysis we consider several communities around the U.S. on the bases of tonnage and type of material recycled, fuel and electricity consumed in collection and separation, and avoided virgin materials consumption. By examining data from a small range of communities and MRF, we arrive at three main conclusions. First, a change from DS to SS results in approximately a 50% increase in production of recyclable commodities. Second, the net result of the DS–SS transition is approximately 710kgCO2-equiv. avoided per metric ton of collection. Third, the emissions associated with collection and MRF operation are small in comparison to avoided emissions from avoided consumption of virgin materials.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Energy consumption is increasing day by day, thereby depleting the fossil fuel reserve at an alarming rate. The fossil-based fuels have many adverse effects on the environment and cause global warming due to emission of greenhouse gases. Biodiesel produced via the transesterification process is an alternative, eco-friendly, and renewable fuel. Transesterification is carried out using homogeneous, enzyme, and heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts can resolve the issues faced by the homogeneous and enzyme catalysts during biodiesel synthesis. At the same time, heterogeneous nanocatalysts have much more potential due to their higher surface area, more selectivity, and stronger catalytic activity. In this review, various nanocatalysts such as metal oxides (CaO, MgO, ZnO, Ti2O, CuO, and ZrO2), magnetic nanocatalyst, nano-zeolite catalyst, and nano-hydrotalcite catalysts were studied. In addition, catalyst preparation methods, physical properties of catalyst along with various reaction parameters such as reaction temperature and time, methanol to oil molar ratio (MTOMR), catalyst loading, and biodiesel yield were highlighted and discussed. In short, biodiesel synthesis using nanocatalyst can provide a cheap and clean energy and thus the nanocatalyst can be further developed as a strong candidate for the global energy industry in the future.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is commonly used for packaging of different products because of its resistance to chemical attack and environmental degradation, but the proper disposal of this nonbiodegradable material has been a major challenge. This research investigated the reuse of this material as addition to clay in fired bricks, PET was mix with lateritic clay at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%. The bricks were fired in a kiln to about 900 °C for 48 h, after which the samples were tested for water absorption, firing shrinkage, density and mechanical tests. The result revealed that the 15 and 20% brick samples disintegrated at high temperature, while the lower percentage samples were deformed at their edges. The 0, 5 and 10% samples gave a compressive strength results of 5.15, 2.30 and 0.85 N/mm2 respectively, while the modulus of rupture values are 13.20, 11.96, 8.53 N/mm2 respectively. Water absorption results for the three samples were 10.29, 9.43, and 6.57% respectively and all are within the acceptable limits. This work concluded that less than 5% PET can be used in fired bricks under controlled conditions.',\n",

Biomedical waste generated during COVID-19 patient isolation, testing and care needs special consideration as it challenges the previous notion that only 15–20% of waste can be considered infectious. With establishment of new home quarantine facility, isolation/quarantine centres the chances of general waste getting contaminated with biomedical waste has increased exponentially. Through this systematic review the authors searched for all possible queries raised by different researchers on COVID19 waste management on Pubmed. A summary of all the different issues unique to COVID19 waste was prepared. Guidelines, rules and recommendation given by national and international agencies published till date were taken into account while trying to answer all the above questions raised by different studies. The key step in COVID19 waste management is segregation of biomedical waste from solid waste. Waste generated from COVID19 patients is like any other infectious waste, therefore creating public awareness about the COVID19 waste hazards and segregation at source is highlighted in all guidelines as a recommendation. These guidelines for management of waste generated during diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients, are required to be followed in addition to existing practices under regulation. BMWM in COVID-19 context is a public health concern and is both a legal and social responsibility for all stakeholders.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'Polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) are two major components of household plastic waste whose blends are immiscible. Recycling them together is an attractive option that requires a compatibilization process to improve the blend mechanical properties. If a PE/PS copolymer is added or formed in situ, it may act as compatibilizer. The structure and molecular properties of this copolymer are key factors to assure its effectivity as a compatibilizer. In this work, we study the graft copolymerization reaction between polystyrene and polyethylene using the catalytic system composed of AlCl3 and styrene. We develop a model of this process which considers that PE/PS grafting and PS degradation occur simultaneously. We propose a kinetic mechanism for the whole process and apply the method of moments to solve the mass balance equations. The model is able to calculate average molecular weights as well as the amount of grafted PS. It accurately describes the available experimental data, constituting a valuable tool for simulation and optimization purposes.',\n",

In this case, the use of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as acid catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins overcomes some diffusional limitations and expands the selectivity of products. Thus, the purpose of work was to promote a secondary porosity in ZSM-5 zeolite by NaOH treatment (using conventional electric and microwave heating methods), applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as pore-directing agent. Both heating methods generated additional secondary porosity, with microwave heating promoting a narrow pore size distribution, when compared to conventional. All hierarchical ZSM-5 have been showed low-density polyethylene conversions superior to the purely microporous ZSM-5, however the hierarchical zeolite processed by conventional electric heating reached the higher temperature reduction (42.6 K). It was evidenced through measurements of morphological and textural properties, ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking that the CTAB cations exerts a protective effect at alkaline treatment avoiding the desilication process. The additional secondary porosity promoting the generation of compounds of lower molecular mass in LDPE catalytic cracking, by thermogravimetric analysis, proving that the alkaline treatment increases the accessibility to the active acidic sites of zeolitic catalysts for bulky molecules.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Microplastics (MPs) could serve as vectors of antibiotics and heavy metals through sorption and desorption. However, the combined adsorption process of antibiotics and heavy metals on aged MPs has rarely been studied. In this study, combined adsorption/desorption of tetracycline (TC) and Cd(II) on/from polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs, as well as ultraviolet (UV) and H2O2 aged MPs, was investigated. The specific surface areas of the MPs increased after UV and H2O2 aging. Adsorption experiments showed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich model fitted adsorption of TC and Cd(II) on all of the MPs. The adsorption capacities of TC and Cd(II) were higher on aged MPs than on the pristine MPs, especially on H2O2 treated MPs. TC adsorption on the MPs was hardly affected by Cd(II), and Cd(II) adsorption was not significantly affected by TC when the solution pH value was below 8.0. Cd(II) slightly enhanced TC adsorption on the MPs at pH 8.0, especially on the aged MPs. The TC adsorption capacities increased with increasing pH, reaching a maximum at pH 5.0 or 6.0, and they then decreased, while the largest level of Cd(II) adsorption was at approximately pH 6.0. Adsorption of TC and Cd(II) on the pristine and aged MPs was thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous. The trend of the desorption rates of TC and Cd(II) from the MPs in different background solutions was ultrapure water < surface water < simulated gastric fluid. The desorption rates of TC and Cd(II) from the aged MPs were lower than those from the pristine MPs. The results revealed the mechanism of the TC and Cd(II) combined adsorption process on aged MPs, which will provide insight for understanding the aging process and its potential effects on sorption and desorption of antibiotics and heavy metals in the real environment.',\n",

Finally, economic and environmental analysis of the process was performed. The results showed that the amount of steam produced by the boiler to cool the exhaust gases of the furnace from 750 to 300 °C is equal to 298 tons per day. This amount of steam has a bar pressure of 24 and a temperature of 350 °C. The steam sent to the turbine generates 4 MW of electricity. The waste incinerated per day is equal to 180 tons, which requires 1,200 tons of air per day to perform the combustion process. After completing the simulation, it was found that the obtained turbine power is equal to 4.052 MW, which has an error value of 1.34% and also the furnace power is equal to 67510000 kJ / h.

       " {'context': '               Plastics are part and parcel of the life of human beings. Plastic waste production has increased exponentially over the years with increased use of plastics in every field possible, but its management techniques are yet developing. The statistics indicate the shift of global leaders of plastic production industry from Europe to China in the last decade. Although the plastic waste production per capita is high in the developed countries, so is the efficiency in the management. Countries like China, India, and other low and middle-income countries produce waste in large quantities pertaining to their huge population and are very inefficient in its management. Plastic waste management can be primarily categorized into mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling (FR), incineration, and landfilling. Mechanical recycling involves the recovery of products without significant changeover of its molecular structure or its physical properties and to be reused for a similar purpose. It can be applied to all the types of plastics. FR involves structural and molecular level changes to the plastic and conversion to its raw material or feed material to be used in a different application. Depending on the process and its parameters, it can be pyrolysis, gasification that can be modified according to the product properties and proportion required. Waste to energy involves the conversion of matter to energy and can be done with minimal presorting and cleaning. The problems of air pollution and residual ash management are to be dealt with separately. Landfilling is the least preferable option and is only better than unsanitary disposal in the waste dumps. It consumes land and environmentally is not sustainable. This chapter deals with the types of plastics and their properties, plastic production industry, plastic waste generation statistics, compares the different types of plastic waste management techniques economically and environmentally, and global prospects of plastic in the future.

Because of the high addedvalue components, the carton packaging highlights among the wastes generated in large urban areas. The manufacture of tiles (or plates) and the pyrolysis are the main routes for the recycling of these wastes. In literature, the conical spouted bed has been pointed out as a promising air-solid contact system for processing the pyrolysis. Thus, this research aims to analyze the air-carton packaging waste flow dynamics in a conical spouted bed. The flow behavior of air-waste was experimentally investigated by analyzing data of bed pressure drop, air velocity and fountain height. Moreover, the simulation of operating conditions in the conical spouted bed was conducted using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It was found that particles of carton packaging in a shaped of disks do not achieve the spouting regime. However, for beds with mixtures composed of polyethylene and carton disks(5 and 10% carton weight), the spouting regimes wereattained.Furthermore, the simulations in ANSYS FLUENT software using the Eulerian Granular Multiphase model showed good agreement with experimental data.',\n",

The MPs were exposed to mechanical agitation and UV irradiation equivalent to one year of solar UVB + UVA in a stirred photoreactor. Flow cytometry was used to track the formation of small (1–25 μm) MPs by applying Mie's theory to derive the size of MP particles from scattering intensity readings. The calculation was based on a calibration with polystyrene (PS) beads. The results showed that the generation of 1–5 μm MP reached 104-105 MPs in the 1–25 μm range per gram of LDPE. ATR-FTIR and micro-FTIR measurements evidenced the formation of oxygenated moieties, namely hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carbon-oxygen bonds, which increased with irradiation time. We also found evidence of the production of a high number of nanoplastics (<1 μm, NPs). The Dynamic Light Scattering size of secondary NPs was in the hundreds of nm range and might represent up to 1010 NPs per gram of LDPE. Our results allowed the unambiguous spectroscopic assessment of the generation of NPs from LDPE under conditions simulating environmental exposure to UV irradiation and used flow cytometry for the first-time to track the formation of secondary MPs.\",\n",

       " {'context': '               The inefficient management practices of the rapidly growing waste quantities impose serious environmental risks and overlook the resource value of the discarded materials. Waste-to-energy (WTE) systems have emerged aiming to mitigate such negative impacts and seize potential opportunities. However, decision makers often face difficulties to determine the optimum setting of WTE within integrated solid waste management (ISWM) strategies that are tailored to meet their specific needs and constraints. Recently, soft computing techniques have proven their functionality in combating such challenges and solving ill-defined multiparameter problems. This chapter presents a multi-objective dynamic framework for the optimization of waste allocation to various treatment, recovery, and disposal facilities by means of genetic algorithms (GAs). The waste processing byproducts were also optimized within the proposed framework. The optimum ISWM strategy was identified on the basis of three main objectives: maximum economic gains, minimum environmental footprint, and maximum energy recovery. The weighted importance of each objective was incorporated in the model to account for the trade-offs between incompatible objectives. The proposed optimization framework was validated from various sustainability perspectives on a case study over a 20-year assessment period. The obtained solution mostly involved the allocation of readily biodegradables to anaerobic digesters, recyclables to material recovery facilities (MRFs), and non-recyclables to incinerators. The optimized strategy suggested the diversion of the by-produced digestate, MRF rejects, and ash to the market, landfill, and incinerator, respectively. Such optimum hybrid ISWM strategy would save around 2.8 billion USD, emit approximately 13,357\\xa0Gg CO2e, and generate more than 109\\xa0TWh over 20 years. Overall, the GA-based solution method was found to effectively determine the optimal dynamic allocation of primary and secondary waste streams, satisfying multiple objectives.            ',\n",

Cost, energy and revenue are mostly adopted to draw the blueprint of upgrading municipal solid waste management system, while the carbon footprint emissions criterion rarely acts asa crucial factor. This study aims to alert Malaysian stakeholders on the uneven danger of carbon footprint emissions of waste technologies. Hence, three scenarios have been proposed and assessed mainly on the carbon footprint emissions using the 2006 IPCC methodology. The first scenario is waste dumping in sanitary landfills equipped with gas recovery system, while the second scenario includes anaerobic digestion of organics and recycling of recyclable wastes such as plastic, glass and textile wastes. The third scenario is waste incineration. Besides the carbon footprint emissions criterion, other environmental concerns were also examined. The results showed that the second scenario recorded the lowest carbon footprint emissions of 0.251t CO2 eq./t MSW while the third scenario had the highest emissions of 0.646t CO2 eq./t MSW. Additionally, the integration between anaerobic digestion and recycling techniques caused the highest avoided CO2 eq. emissions of 0.74t CO2 eq./t MSW. The net CO2 eq. emissions of the second scenario equaled −0.489t CO2 eq./t MSW due to energy recovery from the biogas and because of recycled plastic, glass and textile wastes that could replace usage of raw material. The outcomes also showed that the first scenario generates huge amount of leachate and hazardous air constituents. The study estimated that a ton of dumped waste inside the landfills generates approximately 0.88m3 of trace risky compounds and 0.188m3 of leachate. As for energy production, the results showed that the third scenario is capable of generating 639kWh/t MSW followed by the second scenario with 387.59kWh/t MSW. The first scenario produced 296.79kWh/t MSW. In conclusion, the outcomes of this study recommend an integrated scenario of anaerobic digestion and recycling techniques to be employed in Malaysia.',\n",

       " {'context': 'With the aggressive cost reductions for 3-D printing made available by the open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) the economic advantage of custom distributed manufacturing has become substantial. In addition, the number of free designs is growing exponentially and the development and commercialization of the recyclebot (plastic extruders that fabricate 3-D printing filament from recycled or virgin materials) have greatly improved the material selection available for prosumer 3-D printer operators. These trends indicate that more individuals will manufacturer their own polymer products, however, there is a risk that an even larger fraction of polymer waste will not be recycled because it has not been coded. The current limited resin identification code available in the U.S. similarly restricts closing the loop on less popular polymers, which could hamper the environmental impact benefits of distributed manufacturing. This paper provides a solution for this challenge by (1) developing a recycling code model based off of the resin identification codes developed in China that is capable of expansion as more complex 3-D printing materials are introduced, (2) creating OpenSCAD scripts based on (1) to be used to print resin identification codes into products, (3) demonstrating the use of this functionality in a selection of products and polymer materials, and (4) outlining the software and policy tools necessary to make this application possible for widespread adoption. Overall the results showed that a far larger resin code identification system can be adopted in the U.S. to expand distributed recycling of polymers and manufacturing of plastic-based 3-D printed products.',\n",

This study evaluated the adsorption performances of spent lithium iron phosphate (SLFP) and spent lithium manganate (SLMO) cathodes as adsorbents toward heavy metals in water. The effects of adsorption time, initial adsorbate concentrations, and co-existing ions on adsorption kinetics were examined. SLFP and SLMO demonstrated outstanding adsorption capacities for heavy metals that were higher than or comparable with other reported adsorbents. SLFP shows adsorption capacities of 44.28, 39.54, 25.63, and 27.34 mg g−1 for Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+, respectively, SLMO achieved similar adsorption capacities (32.51, 31.83, 26.24 and 25.25 mg g−1, respectively). Among different adsorption kinetics model, the pseudo-second-order model described heavy metals adsorption kinetics best with R 2 over 0.99, implying that chemisorption may be the predominant adsorption mechanism. The adsorption data at equilibrium well fitted the Langmuir isotherm model with R 2 over 0.96, suggesting that the adsorption process could be endothermic. Cathode materials from of SLIBs may be recycled as adsorbents for heavy metal removal from water, which supports the “waste to treat waste” concept.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Great efforts have long been made to control sediment pollution from persistent organic pollutants and phosphorus for aquatic ecosystem restoration. This study proposed a novel recycling of drinking water treatment residue (DWTR) to synchronously control sediment polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phosphorus pollution based on a 350-day incubation test. The results suggested that DWTR addition reduced approximately 88%− 96% of potential bioavailable PAHs and 76% of mobile phosphorus in sediment. The dominant mechanisms for both reductions by DWTR were immobilization, mainly through increasing sediment amorphous aluminum and iron. The tendency of enhanced PAHs degradation by DWTR was also observed, especially for high molecular weight PAHs (e.g., chrysene, indeno(1, 2, 3-cd)pyrene, and benzo(g, hi)perylene), which decreased by approximately 21.1%− 22.0% of the total. Additionally, accompanying a clear increase in the connections of microbial cooccurrence networks, the variations in bioavailable PAHs, amorphous aluminum and iron, and other properties (e.g., pH, nitrogen, and organic matter) significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced Flavobacterium enrichment, although the enrichment of many other microbes potentially related to PAHs degradation (e.g., C1-B045) decreased after DWTR addition. Therefore, DWTR could promote the construction of a “PAHs immobilization with microbial augmentation” system while immobilizing phosphorus in sediment, indicating the high feasibility of controlling multiple sediment pollution.',\n",

The first part deals with potential and characterization of solid and liquid waste streams in terms of their protein content as well as their pollution potential to the environment. The second part provides an overview of solubilization of proteins from solid wastes using chemical and biochemical techniques together with highlighting the potential of emerging techniques. Then proteins can be recovered from liquid streams using techniques such as precipitation, flocculation, membrane, and chromatography. After protein recovery, waste streams still contain valuable products such as carbohydrates, lipids, reactive nitrogen compounds, phosphorus, and minerals. The last section of this review focuses on how to recycle these waste streams to grow algae, bacteria, and fungi as a single-cell protein, otherwise they need costly treatment steps to reduce negative effects on the environment.

However, printed plastic surfaces cannot be effectively recycled unless the inks are removed. The use of surfactants for deinking rather than organic solvents or chlorine bleaches is environmentally attractive. In this study, the effect of cationic surfactant concentration, pH, process temperature, pre-soaking time, shaking time and abrasion were investigated for blue solvent-based ink on rigid high density polyethylene surfaces. The cationic surfactant (n-hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) was effective only at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and at high pH levels (11.75 and above). Both below and above the CMC, ink removal was promoted by increasing temperature, pre-soaking time and shaking time. The presence of an abrasive also helped to detach the loosened ink from the plastic surface. Solubilization appears to be an important mechanism aiding deinking.',\n",

Firstly, to validate the ability of experimental models derived through near infrared spectroscopy for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polypropylene (PP) in predicting polymers’ aging; focusing on the degree of oxidation. Secondly, to assess the reliability of non-invasive age-predictive models on waste plastic samples and on mechanically recycled samples. Aging time, temperature and number of extrusion cycles were selected as independent variables to build the aging-prediction models, where they were calibrated on samples subjected to controlled conditions. The accuracy of the prediction models was assessed on external samples (aged under known conditions) through the cross correlation technique and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The models exhibited good collinearity for the aging temperature and the number of extrusion cycles factors for all tested polymers, but not for the aging time factor. The RSME value of the aging time factor was far from zero for all polymers. Plastic waste samples provided analogous results; the aging time estimation was mostly negative in value. The estimations of aging time and number of extrusion cycles were always positive in values, where the most reasonable aging factor estimation was the number of extrusion cycles.',\n",

Hydrophobic ZnO nanoparticles modified by oleic acid (OA) were designed and prepared to accelerate the dispersion state of ZnO in the high viscosity polyethylene (HDPE), and enhance the performance of HDPE. HDPE/ZnO nanocomposites with different kinds and fractions of ZnO were further prepared via melt mixing method. The result showed the hexagonal and spindle-like ZnO nanoparticles with size distribution of 150–300 nm was acquired in the absence and presence of OA. Compared with surface untreated ZnO (U-ZnO), ZnO nanoparticles modified by OA (O-ZnO) can disperse evenly into HDPE at the fraction of O-ZnO below 5 wt%. TG data showed the presence of nanosized U-ZnO and O-ZnO in HDPE can significantly enhance the thermal stability of HDPE through raising the activation energy of HDPE in thermal decomposition process. The thermal decomposition order (n) for HDPE/ZnO nanocomposites was mostly bigger than that of HDPE, demonstrating the decomposition mechanism for HDPE became more complicated because of the addition of ZnO nanoparticles. DSC data showed U-ZnO nanoparticles cannot accelerate nucleation of HDPE and seemed to postpone the crystallization process, and O-ZnO nanoparticles was heterogeneous nucleating agent for HDPE. Moreover, the tensile and impact strength of HDPE was improved by the addition of O-ZnO, and connected with the dispersion state of ZnO nanoparticles in HDPE.

It compares an AGL currently manufactured from virgin HDPE (current AGL) with an alternative one made with recycled HDPE (optional AGL). The results obtained show that neither the current nor the optional AGL depict the best environmental performance in all impact categories. Nevertheless, there is a clear overall environmental and economic advantage in replacing virgin HDPE with recycled HDPE. The present work also makes evident that the LCA/LCC integrated model allows the identification of economic and environmental win–win and trade-off situations related to the full life cycle of products.

This study investigated the use of food waste (FW) based pellets composing of 75% food wastes derived from plant materials (cereals, fruit and vegetables) supplemented with yeast and the mixture of bromelain and papain to feed grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Generally, improved growth performance (in terms of feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and relative weight gain) was observed in the diet groups supplemented with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The most optimal dose was 25 g/kg yeast with enzymes (bromelain and papain, at the ratio of 1:1) and protein utilization was enhanced. Fish immunity was also stimulated, which indicated by the higher nitroblue tetrazolium and bactericidal activities. Moreover, resistance against Aeromonas hydrophilia was enhanced. It is envisaged that food waste could be widely used as feeds for culturing herbivorous fish and adding supplements such as baker’s yeast and enzymes will further enhance the feed conversion ratio and fish immunity.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Six acid solids of varying acid and textural characteristics has been investigated for their catalytic activity in the degradation of plastic polymers using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. The polymers included pure low-density polyethylene, pure high-density polyethylene and two samples of recycled polyethylene of urban and agricultural origins. The catalysts were three zeolitic materials (standard ZSM-5, nanocrystalline n-ZSM-5 and Beta) and three mesostructured solids (sol–gel Al-MCM-41 (sg), hydrothermal Al-MCM-41 (hy) and Al-SBA-15). The catalytic activity of each acid solid has been related to its capacity to shift the degradation reaction to lower temperatures. Despite showing strong acid properties, standard ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a very low catalytic activity on most plastics, which was attributed to diffusional impediments that affected the access of the bulky polymer molecules to its internal active sites. These impediments were partly overcome in the case of Beta zeolite and even more markedly with nanocrystalline n-ZSM-5, which exhibited the strongest catalytic activity due to a combination of strong acid properties and large external surface area. Owing to their non-crystalline nature, mesostructured solids showed weaker acid properties than their zeolitic counterparts. However, this disadvantage was partly compensated by the presence of larger pores that reduced diffusional hindrances. Thus, Al-MCM-41 (hy) exhibited one of the highest catalytic activities, largely surpassing the performance of crystalline solids with stronger acid properties. The catalytic activity of all the acid solids tested in this work was significantly reduced when they were used on waste plastics. This deactivating effect was more notable in mesostructured solids.',\n",

After treatment the physicochemical parameters were analysed. The results showed that the values of TOC (26.52 and 37.47%), TOM (36.01 and 33.13%) and C/N (15.02 and 11.92%) ratio are reduced in both VC and VCB whereas, the values of pH (8.01 and 7.56), EC (1.2–1.9\\u202fµs−1 and 1.4–1.9\\u202fµs−1), TP (46.1 and 51%), TMg (50.52 and 64.3%), TCa (50 and 64%), TNa (1.39 and 1.75%) and TK (1.75 and 1.86%) have increased.

       " {'context': '               This chapter presents the idea that there are a range of target plastic products where substitution with biodegradable plastics would be the most effective way to address the issue of plastic solid waste accumulation. These can be determined by considering material flows and identifying the materials most likely to be mismanaged or not practically recyclable (e.g., agricultural films, single-use bags, multilayer materials, linings for cardboard, items likely to be used in events with a large organic waste fraction).               However, this view is not shared by all, and the debate surrounding the role of biodegradable plastics in solving plastic solid waste accumulation and assisting the transition toward a circular economy remains unresolved. Thus, in this chapter, both sides of the debate are presented and reviewed, with the conclusion being that biodegradable plastics should be considered as part of the solution. However, their efficacy in providing an environmentally sound solution to solid waste accumulation will depend on the coemergence of affordable waste sorting technology and investments in organic waste handling facilities (compost and anaerobic digestion).               Further discussion is raised around a number of important points:                                                                              1.                        That parts of the debate questioning the utility of biodegradable plastics need to be challenged as they revolve around factors which while having some basis are misinformed and/or can be addressed.                                                                  2.                        That although mechanical recycling normally emerges as the superior waste processing option by life cycle analysis, all plastic materials have a limited mechanical recycling lifetime (while some materials are simply nonrecyclable) and therefore materials need to also be chemically or biologically recyclable if a “recycling loop” is truly to be implemented.                                                                  3.                        That there will always be a certain level of leakage of materials to the environment, regardless of the improvement in our collection systems. Biodegradable plastics would help to alleviate the impact of this leakage.                                                                  ',\n",

In general, more material is segregated and sent for recycling from leased areas than non-leased ones (administered by the government).

       " {'context': 'The need to increase packaging recycling rates has led to the study and analysis of recycling schemes from various perspectives, including technical, economic, social, and environmental. This paper is part one of a three-part study devoted to comparing two recyclable packaging waste collection systems operating in western Portugal: a mixed collection system, where curbside and drop-off collections are operated simultaneously (but where the curbside system was introduced after the drop-off system), and an exclusive drop-off system. This part of the study focuses on analyzing the operation and performance of the two waste collection systems. The mixed collection system is shown to yield higher material separation rates, higher recycling rates, and lower contamination rates compared with the exclusive drop-off system, a result of the curbside component in the former system. However, the operational efficiency of the curbside collection in the mixed system is lower than the drop-off collection in the mixed system and the exclusive drop-off system, mainly because of inefficiency of collection. A key recommendation is to ensure that the systems should be optimized in an attempt to improve performance. Optimization should be applied not only to logistical aspects but also to citizens’ participation, which could be improved by conducting curbside collection awareness campaigns in the neighborhoods that have a mixed system.',\n",

       " {'context': \"There is a serious need to assess the evolution of transitions from a linear to a Circular Economy (CE) using tools, metrics, and measurement indicators that not only are able to take into account the circularity, but also the other sustainability performances of products. Currently, most measurement tools do not lead to valuable decisions, as they do not capture the performance of the CE in its entirety, resulting in poorer performance on certain aspects, such as the environment. In addition, the lack of industry-specific indicators may hinder the adaptation of CE due to the different structures and functions of products. Consequently, this paper proposes a circularity indicator adapted from the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) for the plastic industry, specifically Multi-layer Plastic Packaging (MPP). The adapted indicator is expanded based on the quality of recycled polymers by defining a new utility factor (X) as the polymers' intensity of re-use. It also highlights that it is necessary to combine a circularity indicator with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for viable end-of-life (EOL) management. To illustrate the use of the proposed indicator and the trade-offs between circularity and environmental impacts, a case study on three-layer plastic packaging is applied to two end-of-life scenarios (Incineration, and closed-loop mechanical recycling). The results show that an increase in material circularity generally decreases the environmental impacts. However, recycling was found to have a higher impact than incineration on some impact categories such as land use and freshwater eutrophication.\",\n",

In present, recycling is aimed as a sustainable plastic waste management of ABS containing BFRs in ways that minimize the potential impact on human health and environment. This study was conducted to facilitate the separation of ABS plastics from heavy plastic mixture by froth flotation after surface rearrangement of ABS with mild heat treatment for its recycling. Hydrophilic moieties would be more likely to develop on the mild heat-treated ABS surfaces than on other plastics perhaps due to the difference of molecular mobility. This provides an excellent base for selective separation of ABS by froth flotation technique. As a result of froth flotation after mild heat treatment, about 97% of ABS with 100% purity was selectively separated from heavy plastics. The detailed mechanism for the selective separation of the ABS in the treatment (froth flotation after mild heat treatment) was discussed. Finally, this study facilities selective separation application effective and inexpensive method for of ABS from waste plastics.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper forms part of research to solve two main problems in Ghana: firstly, the management of municipal solid waste (MSW), particularly with regards to used plastics which have overwhelmed major cities and towns; secondly, the formation of potholes onroads due to excessive traffic and axle weight. This study examines the effect of blending waste thermoplastic polymers, namely High density polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP) in Conventional AC-20 graded bitumen, at various plastic compositions. The plastics were shredded and blended with the bitumen ‘in-situ’, with a shear mixer at a temperature range of 160°C–170°C. Basic rheological parameters such as penetration, ring & ball softening point and viscosity tests were employed to determine the resulting changes from base bitumen.FTIR spectroscopy was also employed to study the chemical functionalities present in the bitumen composite. The properties of the unmodified bitumen were found to be enhanced with the changes recorded in the rheological properties of the polymer modified bitumen (PMB). It was observed that polypropylene polymer, showed profound effect on homogeneity and compatibility with slight linear increment in the viscosity, softening and penetration values as against relatively high changes for HDPE modified bitumen.The viscosity of unmodified bitumen was enhanced with the addition of the polymers and thixotropic effect was observed for both HDPE and PP at 60°C. For all modified binders prepared, the penetration values decrease as polymer-bitumen ratio increases whiles softening temperature generally increases as polymer ratio increases. The most compatible and incompatible blends for HDPE were respectively observed at 2% and 3% polymer loading. The most enhanced, homogenous blend is achieved with PP at 3% polymer loading. Three prominent peaks were identified in the spectrum of the unmodified bitumen, occurring at the 3000–2850cm−1 IR frequency range, typical of aliphatic CH symmetrical and asymmetrical stretches in alkanes. CH2 and CH3 bends were also observed at the characteristic frequencies of 1465cm−1 and 1375cm−1 respectively. A low intensity peak was observed within the 2400cm−1–2100cm−1 range, indicating the presence of a very weak −CC- or −CN group with an absorbance of precisely 0.12.The use of waste commodity plastics in binder modification carries the advantage of a cheap and effective means of enhancing conventional bitumen binder performance characteristics and is an alternative way to utilise plastic waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Fast co-pyrolysis has been suggested as a promising technique to solve the environmental issues and simultaneously recover value-added products from polymer wastes. However, to date, no studies have focused on fast co-pyrolysis of printed circuit boards (PCB) and waste tire (WT). Therefore, we comprehensively investigated the fast co-pyrolysis of PCB and WT using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results show that an increase in temperature during fast pyrolysis improved the interactions between the PCB and WT pyrolyzates, increasing the formation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. The formation of p-cymene was greatly induced by the isomerization and dehydrogenation reactions of D-limonene. Co-pyrolysis reduced the formation of brominated phenols and benzothiazole from PCB and WT pyrolysis, respectively, whereas promoted the interactions between Br- and S/N-containing radicals, concentrating them into heavy compounds. Increasing the temperature enhanced the release of heteroatom compounds. The findings suggest that debromination of PCB achieved via dehydrogenation of WT pyrolysis provoked secondary reactions of olefins and interactions of heteroatom radicals. The major products were accurately predicted by different fitting models using response surface methodology, indicating the synergistic interactions during co-pyrolysis. The results were beneficial for optimizing the experimental parameters to obtain the maximum yield of desired products.',\n",

Not only is it a low-cost commodity polymer, it has a higher theoretical carbon yield (at 100%) than polyacrylonitrile (at 67%) and is very readily melt processed into fibres. The challenge is to efficiently dehydrogenate and graphitize polyethylene fibres. This paper explores the use of bromine as a novel oxidant to functionalise polyethylene prior to carbonisation, leading to efficient cyclisation and carbonisation on heating. Through a process of low-temperature photo-induced liquid-phase bromination followed by dehydrobromination at moderate temperature and subsequent carbonisation to 800 °C, a carbonaceous product was obtained in high carbon yield (>90%). The effects of a range of process conditions, as well as the use of different types of polyethylene and polyethylene blends, were explored.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The acoustic modelling of fibrous materials is fundamental for the design of a sound-absorbing acoustic treatment. Several analytical formulas have been proposed to calculate the acoustic performance of materials made of fibres with a homogeneous diameter and a mono, bi, or three-dimensional distribution, while only a few studies have been carried out on materials made up of a mixture of fibres with non–homogeneous diameter. Fibrous materials for automotive applications, developed both for acoustic and thermal applications, are commonly obtained by moulding mixtures of recycled fibres of different nature, bonded together and compacted with a wide range of variability in density and thickness. The acoustic modelling of the mixtures is thus relevant for the simulation of the performance of the final component. The main goal of the study was to determine the physical properties of a given mixture of fibres to compute its acoustic performance, based on the knowledge of the characteristic of each kind of fibre in the blend composition. A homogenisation process is proposed to determine the effective density and radius of a given mixture according to its composition and the characteristics of each kind of fibre. The normal incidence sound absorption coefficient of the investigated mixtures was computed according to the Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge (JCAL) model, by using the physical parameters, analytically computed from the effective properties of the mixture, as input data. The reliability of the approach was validated by comparing the computed results with the experimental airflow resistivity and the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient measured for five different fibre mixtures, at different compression rates.',\n",

In order to enhance the interfacial adhesion between fibers and HDPE, the chemical treatment of fibers is carried out with the help of NaOH and Maleic Anhydride. On increasing hemp content in the HDPE matrix, a reduction in the tensile strength is reported, with maximum strength noticed at 20% content. However, with the augmentation in the content of hemp fibers from 10% to 30%, flexural strength of the fabricated composite is observed to get reduced.

       " {'context': 'Pyrolysis is a promising technology for the production of marketable energy products from waste mixtures, as it decomposes heterogeneous material into homogenous fuel products. This research assessed the ability of slow pyrolysis to convert three waste streams, composed of fibre residues contaminated with different plastic mixtures, into char and tarry phase products at three different temperatures (300, 425 and 550°C). The products were characterised in terms of mass yield, higher heating value (HHV) and gross energy conversion (EC). Significant amounts of hydrocarbon plastics in the feed materials increased the calorific values of the char (up to 32.9MJ/kg) and tarry phase (up to 42.8MJ/kg) products, comparable to high volatile bituminous A coal and diesel respectively. For all three waste streams converted at 300°C, the majority of the energy in the feedstock was recovered in the char product (>80%), while deoxygenation of fibre component resulted in char with increased calorific value (up to 31.6MJ/kg) being produced. Pyrolysis at 425°C for two of the waste streams containing significant amounts of plastic produced both a valuable char and tarry phase, which resulted in an EC greater than 74%. Full conversion of plastic at 550°C increased the tarry phase yield but dramatically decreased the char HHV. The influence of temperature on product yield and HHV was discussed based on the pyrolysis mechanisms and in relation to the plastic composition of the waste streams.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Biodegradable material, primarily composed of food waste, accounts for 40–70wt% of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developing countries. Therefore, to establish a sustainable waste management system, it is essential to separate and recycle biodegradable organic material from the municipal waste stream. Of all the recycling methods, composting is recommended due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, compared with readily recyclable materials (e.g., paper, metals, etc.), recycling/composting biodegradable MSW presents a great challenge to furthering the promotion of waste recycling. This review provides a systematic analysis of organic waste sorting and recycling/composting practices in several countries: the UK, US, Japan, and China. Compared to the great efforts that have been made in developed countries for the promotion of waste composting, much less has been achieved in developing countries. For example, the MSW composting rate in China decreased from 10% to less than 2% in the past 15 years, and similar trends may exist in other developing countries. Therefore, it is essential to identify the barriers that impede waste composting and predict developing trends. This article emphasizes environmental challenges (i.e., odor, bioaerosols, and heavy metals), focusing on their generation and control strategies, in an effort to identify barriers hindering MSW composting. Successful practices in several European countries suggest that source-separated composting presents many advantages over mechanical-separated composting. This may partially be ascribed to the fact that source separation of organic waste can prevent contact with heavy metal-bearing items, resulting in the production of high-quality compost. Mixed collection MSW normally contains significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals, which could affect the marketing of composting products. Moreover, source separation of organic waste can minimize waste pretreatment operations, leading to lower bioaerosol and malodor generation during composting. Implementing source separation of MSW in more countries would increase the amount of organic waste available for composting. In addition, attention should focus on secondary pollutant production for proper composting management. Finally, setting standards for end product quality control is highly recommended for controlling both marketing and environmental risks.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Everyday waste is a serious matter of concern because of its disruptive impact on the environment. Although disposal and reclaim of such material represent the first lines of intervention to solve this problem, upcycling strategies should eventually be necessary to reconvert huge amounts of the waste. In addition to waste, climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2)) is other global environmental problem. Here, we employed a thermal treatment process conducted in CO2 environment to upcycle waste tea bag (a surrogate feedstock for everyday waste) and utilize CO2 simultaneously. Through lab-scale experiments, 6 wt% caprolactam (a value-added nylon monomer), 12.7 wt% combustible gases (higher heating value (HHV): 24.8 MJ kg−1), and 13.8 wt% char (HHV: 28.1 MJ kg−1) were obtained at 500 °C. Based on the experimental results, a large-scale energy analysis of the process was conducted by developing a simulation model of an integrated process to produce caprolactam-rich liquid product. For the integrated process, CO2 in gaseous product mixture is separated, and the separated CO2 is recirculated to the thermal treatment step. The combustible gases and char are used to supply energy to thermal treatment and separation steps. The proposed process has a significant feature that there is no need for external energy with no CO2 emission (i.e., CO2 is fully recirculated in the waste treatment process).',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper presents an experimental study on the axial stress–strain behavior of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)-confined seawater sea-sand recycled aggregate concrete (SSRAC) columns. Forty-two circular and square specimens were tested under axial compression, and the effects of the aggregate replacement ratio, CFRP thickness, and corner radius were investigated. The results indicated that, by replacing natural aggregates with recycled aggregates (RAs), the CFRP-confinement effectiveness can be enhanced, showing a higher enhancement ratio in the ultimate strength and strain. The effect of the corner radius ratio on the ultimate condition of CFRP-confined SSRAC is also more pronounced compared with CFRP confined natural aggregate concrete (NAC). This conclusion was also validated by the nonuniform hoop strain distribution for specimens with varying corner radius ratios. The difference in CFRP confinement efficiency caused by the recycled aggregate replacement and corner radius is accurately captured by the DIC (Digital image correlation) measurement system. By reasonably taking the coupling effect of RAs and the corner radius ratio into account for the confinement efficiency parameter, the proposed ultimate strength and strain model for CFRP-confined SSRAC demonstrates a satisfactory performance when compared with test results.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study provides a novel method, Fenton oxidation combined with flotation, to facilitate separation of waste polymethyl methacrylate and polyvinyl chloride mixtures for recycling. Fenton oxidation was found to induce selective surface hydrophilization of polymethyl methacrylate and suppress its flotation recovery in flotation, thereby facilitating its flotation separation with polyvinyl chloride. The surface hydrophilization occurred on polymethyl methacrylate surface was confirmed by the contact angle that decreased from 95.80° to 73.11°, and was attributed to the changes in surface hydrophilic groups and morphology. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed the formation of uniformly micrometer-scale spotted-structures on polymethyl methacrylate surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ascertained the obvious increase of elemental ratio of O/C and the introduction of hydrophilic groups (carbonyl and hydroxyl). The optimized conditions obtained for separation of polymethyl methacrylate and polyvinyl chloride mixtures were [H2O2]/[Fe2+] ratio of 3000, hydrogen peroxide concentration of 0.2\\u202fM, reaction time of 6.0\\u202fmin, pH of 5.80, reaction temperature of 25.0\\u202f°C, flotation time of 3.0\\u202fmin, frother dosage of 14.8\\u202fmg/L, and airflow rate of 6.0\\u202fmL/min. Under optimized conditions, for the samples with particle size of 0.9–4.0\\u202fmm, the recovery and the purity of polyvinyl chloride were 100% and 97.61%, and the recovery and the purity of polymethyl methacrylate were 97.55% and 100%, respectively. Particularly for the particle size of 3.2–4.0\\u202fmm, the purity and recovery of polyvinyl chloride and polymethyl methacrylate all reached up to 100%. Reusing of Fenton and flotation solutions was evaluated, and results indicated they can be used at least 3 and 5 times, respectively. Besides, a simple economic analysis demonstrated that this method is economically feasible. In conclusion, this environmentally friendly, sustainable, and economically feasible method contributes to improve the recycling quality of waste plastics, and provides technological insights in the cleaner and sustainable disposal of waste plastics.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study examines the contours of electronic waste (“e-waste”) governance in Ghana, one of the top five importers of e-waste in the world, as well as the site of one of the most intensive e-waste scrapyards in the world, Agbogbloshie. At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana’s most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks. Then, it identifies a concert of fifteen different policy recommendations as well as four research gaps. It concludes by emphasizing the duality of the e-waste phenomenon and e-waste policy, and by underscoring the political economy dynamics of e-waste activities and practices.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The Dutch post-consumer plastic packaging recycling network has been described in detail (both on the level of packaging types and of materials) from the household potential to the polymeric composition of the recycled milled goods. The compositional analyses of 173 different samples of post-consumer plastic packaging from different locations in the network were combined to indicatively describe the complete network with material flow analysis, data reconciliation techniques and process technological parameters. The derived potential of post-consumer plastic packages in the Netherlands in 2014 amounted to 341\\u202fGg net (or 20.2\\u202fkg\\u202fnet.cap−1.a−1). The complete recycling network produced 75.2\\u202fGg milled goods, 28.1\\u202fGg side products and 16.7\\u202fGg process waste. Hence the net recycling chain yield for post-consumer plastic packages equalled 30%. The end-of-life fates for 35 different plastic packaging types were resolved. Additionally, the polymeric compositions of the milled goods and the recovered masses were derived with this model. These compositions were compared with experimentally determined polymeric compositions of recycled milled goods, which confirmed that the model predicts these compositions reasonably well. Also the modelled recovered masses corresponded reasonably well with those measured experimentally. The model clarified the origin of polymeric contaminants in recycled plastics, either sorting faults or packaging components, which gives directions for future improvement measures.',\n",

       " {'context': \"               Wastewater is degraded and discarded water inevitably and ubiquitously generated from human facilities and anthropogenic activities, and discharged into the environment. It is a cocktail of countless chemicals, both beneficial and harmful ones ranging from organic matter to toxic metals, nutrients to persistent organic pollutants and pathogens, and is therefore, rightly regarded as a blessing in disguise. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6.3 urges humanity reducing pollution, discharge of hazardous contaminants mixed in wastewaters into the waterbodies, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing safe reuse, recycling and resource recovery globally by 2030. It calls for a paradigm shift in the approach of wastewater treatment and its reclamation from capital and energy intensive conventional technology to low-cost, environment friendly, sustainable ecotechnology. Ecotechnology is the design of sustainable systems in sync with natural systems following ecological principles, which integrate human society with its natural environment for mutual benefits. It uses Nature as model, measure, and mentor, attempts to design with Nature, and follows the ecological principles of reliance on solar energy, species cooperation, and material cycling and regeneration. The basic idea is that our treatment system can be modeled on natural ecosystems. The working and architecture of natural systems offer a blueprint for such technological design. The design philosophy, in essence, takes advantage of the wealth of information available from Mother Nature's living library—its biodiversity. The present book chapter attempts to present a comprehensive picture of nature-inspired ecological treatment, regenerative reclamation and valorization of wastewater through closing the loop. It shows how ecosystem mimics portray structural diversity yet functional unity in different ecotechnologies such as living machines, floating treatment wetlands, waste stabilization ponds train, constructed wetlands, hydroponics, and wastewater-fed aquaculture, all employing a range of functional organisms from Mother Nature's living library, comprising microbes, macrophytes, mollusks, fish, and other species, as a collaborative enterprise.            \",\n",

For this study, potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) was introduced to modify BiOBr via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method, where uniformly dispersed KPF6 on BiOBr nanosheets improved H2O2 yields and the pollutant degradation performance. Such materials have proven to be critical for low bandgap and enhanced surface charge separation for efficient H2O2 production. The optimized sample of 20 wt% KPF6/BiOBr showed a H2O2 production rate of 53.36 mg·L–1, which was much higher than that of pure BiOBr (27.19 mg·L–1). Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) superoxide radical detection results suggested that two-step single-electron oxygen reduction was the primary pathway. More importantly, discarded polyethylene bags from supermarkets have been decomposed though the in-situ generation of H2O2 using KPF6/BiOBr materials, and the mass loss of plastics was 2.33 times higher than that of the pure BiOBr.

However, the applicability of data is limited by the regional, temporal and technical scope of waste characterisation studies. As Danish and European legislation aims for higher recycling rates evaluation of source-segregation and recycling chains gain importance. This paper provides a consistent up-to-date dataset for 74 physico-chemical parameters in 49 material fractions from residual and 24 material fractions from source-segregated Danish household waste. Significant differences in the physico-chemical properties of residual and source-segregated waste fractions were found for many parameters related to organic matter, but also for elements of environmental concern. Considerable differences in potentially toxic metal concentrations between the individual recyclable fractions within one material type were observed. This indicates that careful planning and performance evaluation of recycling schemes are important to ensure a high quality of collected recyclables. Rare earth elements (REE) were quantified in all waste fractions analysed, with the highest concentrations of REE found in fractions with high content of mineral raw materials, soil materials and dust. The observed REE concentrations represent the background concentration level in non-hazardous waste materials that may serve as a reference point for future investigations related to hazardous waste management. The detailed dataset provided here can be used for assessments of waste management solutions in Denmark and for the evaluation of the quality of recyclable materials in waste.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study examines the wetting–drying durability of soft clay soil stabilized with recycled Bassanite, produced from gypsum waste. Specifically, this study focuses on an investigation of the effects of the moisture conditions on the strength performance and durability of very soft clay soil stabilized with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures during the wetting–drying cycles, referred to as weathering conditions in this study. Cylindrical stabilized soil specimens were produced and then cured for 28 days. The cured specimens were subjected to different numbers of wetting–drying cycles, and then tested for unconfined compressive strength. The results show that the compressive strength increased with an increase in the Bassanite content for the different wetting–drying cycles investigated. The increase in the Bassanite content is associated with the increase in the dry unit weight, as well as in the decrease in the moisture content of the stabilized specimens for the different wetting–drying cycles investigated. The compressive strength of the soil stabilized with the Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures gradually decreases with an increase in the number of wetting–drying cycles, and the earlier cycles are seen to have a more negative effect on durability than the later cycles. Generally, the influence of the wetting–drying cycles on changes in the strength, durability and volume of the soft clay soil stabilized with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures is not significant. This is evidence that the use of recycled Bassanite, produced from gypsum waste to stabilize soft clay soil, achieves acceptable durability, raises the strength performance and improves the engineering properties of soft clay soil in a wet environment. In addition, the effective use of gypsum waste contributes to the development of a sustainable society by reducing the huge quantity of solid waste and establishing a sound environment.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The production of syngas from the pyrolysis-catalytic reforming of processed municipal solid waste in the form of refuse derived fuel has been investigated experimentally using a two-stage fixed bed reactor with a 10 wt% Ni–Al2O3 catalyst. The reforming gases used were a combination of steam and carbon dioxide (dry reforming). The main focus of the research was to manipulate the H2:CO ratio in the syngas for targeted end-use applications by optimizing the process conditions, including the input steam/CO2 reforming gas ratio. The experimental results showed that at higher steam:CO2 ratios, there was a marked increase in H2 yield due to the endothermic nature of the steam and CO2 reforming processes. The catalytic reforming temperature also had a major influence on H2 yield, with increasing temperature raising the hydrogen yield to a maximum of ∼41.0 mmol gRDF −1 at 955 °C catalyst temperature. The H2:CO molar ratio was also affected by the process variables and were interdependent on them. For example, the influence of an increase in the catalytic reforming temperature as the content of steam in the reforming gas input was also increased, produced a maximum H2:CO molar ratio of ∼4.7:1 achieved at an input steam:CO2 ratio of 75:25 and a catalyst temperature of 700 °C. Whereas, at higher CO2 content in the reforming gas, the product H2:CO ratio was ∼1:1. Also, for a steam:CO2 input ratio of 50:50, the H2:CO ratio produced was ∼2:1 and for higher steam content in the reforming gas the product H2:CO was ∼3:1. Design of Experiments (DoE) modelling was carried out using the experimental data to identify the process conditions that would produce a target syngas H2:CO molar ratio of 1:1 and 2:1. The predicted optimised process conditions from the DoE modelling produced experimental results close to the targeted syngas H2:CO molar ratios, thereby validating the DoE model.',\n",

       " {'context': 'An integrated reactor/separation semi-batch catalytic pyrolysis reactor system, based on a distillation approach, was developed to produce gaseous hydrocarbons, to be used as feedstock or fuel in the perspective of a Circular Economy approach. This work intends to be a proof of concept and to test the operating conditions and performance of the reactor to control the molecular weight of the products. For that purpose, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions. Different temperatures were used (400, 450 and 500\\u202f°C) for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, with 1% (w/w) of HZSM-5. The influence of the temperature of the coolant at the outlet of the reactor was also investigated for the catalytic degradation of the HDPE at 450\\u202f°C, providing a way to control the average molecular weight of the recovered products, which increased with increasing coolant temperature. The focus of the study was to develop an integrated reactor/separation system where only the lighter compounds produced could leave the reactor and thus direct the production to chemical feedstock to be reused in petrochemistry, including in the production of new plastics. The analysis of the volatile products indicated that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C2 to C8. Higher amounts of C3 to C5 were formed, with a particular emphasis on olefins, with very high yields in the case of catalytic pyrolysis. The activity of the catalysts after use was also checked through the ARDT index (Ability to Reduce the Decomposition Temperature), with values for this index above 50% which indicate a good possibility for reuse of the catalyst.',\n",

       " {'context': 'A waste liquid crystal display (LCD) panel was recycled synthetically and cleanly by using dry physical methods, namely, mechanical exfoliation, dry crushing and vibrated gas–solid fluidized bed separation. Results of elemental and phase analyses show that indium and tin contents were enriched greatly in indium tin oxide concentrate obtained from colour filter and thin-film transistor glass. The results of crushing, ash content and scanning electron microscopic analyses show that when the LCD panel was crushed into particles smaller than 0.25mm, the polarizer film is nearly completely liberated from the glass. Moreover, the results of vibrated gas–solid fluidized bed separation show that gas velocity and separation time are the main factors influencing the separation. The vibration intensity of 6.8, gas velocity of 13.6cm/s and fluidizing time of 30s are the optimum operating parameters, and the degree of separation and recovery of polarizing film reached up to 37.69 and 72.3%, respectively. Based on these results, the combination of dry enrichment, dry crushing and dry separation in a flowsheet is proposed for recycling of waste LCD panel.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Bioplastics are plastics derived from natural resources like corn starch, biomass, sugarcane bagasse, and food waste. Unlike fossil fuel-based plastics, they are bio-degradable entirely or partially. Therefore, bioplastics are relatively less harmful to the environment. Cellulose and starch-based bioplastics are already used for applications like packaging, cutlery, bowls, straws. However, their cost and performance cannot match the conventional plastics. The present study was aimed to produce bioplastic from food waste material. As a result, orange peel is chosen because of its high cellulose content and good availability. The bio-plastic film from orange peel was produced using simple laboratory techniques. Its identification for potential applications is the new area of work. The developed film blends with glycerol as a plasticizer have indicated consistent and promising results. This has excellent strength, flexibility, and disintegration in soiling conditions, morphologically having a rough surface, and confirms the film's bio-degradability nature. Characterization methods such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), powderX-ray diffraction (XRD), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis confirmed that the developed material's physicochemical and surface morphology belonged to bio-based plastic. A simple, novel, and economic process are described in the manufacturing of bio-based plastic.\",\n",

Discarded personal computers (PCs), Tvs, kitchen and audio equipment are among the most popular items to be recycled, yielding valuable polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polycarbonate and different varieties of polystyrene. The process of mechanical recycling is to collect, sort, size reduce, separate and densify these wastes, economically and effectively. The effectiveness of separation techniques such as flotation, hydro-cyclone, air tabling, near infra-red and electrostatic sorting are examined. The variations in effective WEEE collection and treatment among European Union member states are also discussed. Future work with WEEE plastics is based on the acceptable use of immiscible polymers through processing or chemical modification. An alternative area of research is to make the polymers easier to separate and research appears to be ongoing to minimise the use of different polymer types in a product, making the recycling process far simpler.

In addition, the recycling rates of current municipal waste management are low. In this regard, this study aims at estimating the climate change impact of current food delivery packaging and its waste treatment, by performing a Life Cycle Assessment with a cradle-to-grave approach. In addition, this article explores the potential benefits of increasing the current recycling rates, the recycled content of the packaging as well as the use of reusable packaging. For this study, the food packaging of a typical dumpling-based meal of the popular Chinese restaurant Xijiade was selected. Based on this menu and the current Chinese consumption patterns, the food delivery packaging in China would have emitted about 13 million tons of CO2eq. Increasing current recycling rates to 35% would reduce 16% the emissions of single-use packaging, and further decrease (60%) could be found if half of the packaging was made of recycled material. In addition, if single-use packaging was replaced by reusable PP-based packaging (food container and carrier bag), the emissions would potentially be 63% lower than the current situation. In this case, doubling the recycling rates and the recycled content of the reusable food packaging would represent an extra 6 and 17% reduction of emissions, respectively.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Most PET bottles used as beverage containers become waste after their usage, causing environmental problems. To address this issue, a method to recycle wasted PET bottles is presented, in which short fibers made from recycled PET are used within structural concrete. To verify the performance capacity of recycled PET fiber reinforced concrete, it was compared with that of polypropylene (PP) fiber reinforced concrete for fiber volume fractions of 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%. Appropriate tests were performed to measure material properties such as compressive strength, elastic modulus, and restrained drying shrinkage strain. Flexural tests were performed to measure the strength and ductility capacities of reinforced concrete (RC) members cast with recycled PET fiber reinforced concrete. The results show that compressive strength and elastic modulus both decreased as fiber volume fraction increased. Cracking due to drying shrinkage was delayed in the PET fiber reinforced concrete specimens, compared to such cracking in non-reinforced specimens without fiber reinforcement (NF), which indicates crack controlling and bridging characteristics of the recycled PET fibers. Regarding structural member performance, ultimate strength and relative ductility of PET fiber reinforced RC beams are significantly larger than those of companion specimens without fiber reinforcement.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Co-gasification of biomass and plastic blends has been extensively studied, however the effect of AAEMs (alkali and alkaline earth metals) in biomass on the co-gasification behavior still remains unknown. Acid and alkali pretreatment were used here to remove or introduce the AAEMs in biomass by ion-exchange method. SEM was used to obtain morphological characteristics of three pretreated pine wood (PW) samples; TG analysis of pure and blend feedstocks was used to examine the decomposition behavior. CO2 assisted co-gasification of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and pretreated PW samples at different blend ratios were conducted in a fixed bed reactor, and the resulting flow rate and yields of H2, CO, light hydrocarbons (HC), total syngas, and output energy determined. Synergetic effects from these blends during co-gasification were evaluated by comparing the experimental results with the weighted results from individual components. Results showed that the presence of AAEMs in biomass resulted in increased char yield and char reactivity, that enhanced the syngas yield and energy output. However, acid pretreatment with low AAEM content showed the opposite trend. Irrespective of the biomass pretreatment, synergistic effect was found in the yield of each syngas component, total syngas, and energy yield during its co-gasification with HDPE plastic. The synergy during co-gasification of HDPE and alkali treated PW was more pronounced at high PW content, while those from acid pretreatment preferred low PW fraction. The highest energy yields of 28.1, 34.3 and 30.1 kJ/g were obtained from co-gasification of HDPE and water, acid and alkali pretreated PW samples at PW fraction of 44%, 22% and 55%, respectively. Maximum synergistic effect with energy yield of 69% was obtained from the gasification of HDPE and acid pretreated PW at 27% PW fraction. These results help to our understanding of the influence of biomass pretreatment on co-gasification of biomass-plastic mixtures. The results also help to achieve relatively stable energy output for varying mixtures of plastic and biomass.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Serious environmental problems are due to large amounts of polymer waste, which are mostly thrown into landfills. As we known, polymer composites has been used to produce a variety of products like acid tanks, manholes, drains, highway median barriers, and so forth. One option is to use waste polymers as aggregates in polymer composites. In this work, waste polymers (PET, polycarbonate and automotive tires), partially replaced silica sand in polyester based mortar. Waste particles (0.7–2.36\\u202fmm), in concentrations of 1, 2 and 3% by weight, were used. The polymer mortar specimens were subjected to compressive and flexural tests, and the elasticity modulus was calculated. In addition, mechanical values were calculated by Finite Element Method (FEM), and compared with experimental data. Surface morphology and degree of crystallinity of waste particles were analyzed by SEM and XRD techniques, respectively. The results show improvement on the mechanical strength (up to 20%) for polymer mortar with waste PET; but lower mechanical values when adding polycarbonate or tire particles, compared to control mortar. These mechanical results can be related to the crystallinity degree, because PET particles shown higher crystallinity than those for polycarbonate and tire particles. This work is an alternative to reduce environmental contamination through to use waste polymers as fillers in polymer mortars.',\n",

The goals of the present study were: 1) identify the optimal conditions to obtain maximum yields of the liquid fraction, 2) experimentally measure basic characteristic parameters of pyrolytic oils, 3) use correlations or equations used in the hydrocarbon industry to estimate the measured properties, 4) make a comparison between the measured and calculated properties by predictive mathematical expressions, 5) develop new correlations for estimating pyrolytic oil properties. As main results, the optimal temperature to obtain maximum yield of liquid fraction was 500 °C. The physical and chemical properties of pyrolytic oils changed as temperature increased due to the presence of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Also, the approximation of the chromatography data allowed to determine, by simulated distillation, the potential fuel yields that will be obtained if processed as synthetic crude in an atmospheric tower and a vacuum tower. Finally, two novel modified equations were proposed to estimate the specific gravity and refractive index parameter for pyrolytic oils.',\n",

The total amount of plastic waste was estimated at 80 million tons in 2015, showing an increasing trend. A significant proportion of the total plastic waste is polypropylene (PP). PP offers good mechanical and chemical properties and can be manufactured and molded in a cost- and energy-efficient manner. This amount of plastic waste is forcing society to develop sustainable recycling strategies. For this reason, commercially available PP feedstocks made from post-consumer waste are available for manufacturing. These materials are primarily designed for injection molding or extrusion processes. Additive manufacturing, and in particular material extrusion-based additive manufacturing (ME-AM), has gained significant momentum over the past decade and is already widely used not only for prototyping but also for series production. PP is a material that is typically challenging to process by ME-AM due to its high crystallinity, high shrinkage, and poor adhesion properties. Therefore, this work investigates the use and applicability of PP recyclates in ME-AM. For this purpose, filaments were produced from a commercial grade PP recyclate and tensile specimens were printed with different printing parameters. The mechanical properties were compared to those of injection molded parts and a good relative performance of 64% to 81% was obtained. Although PP seems to be difficult to process with ME-AM, with an optimized print setup and suitable processing parameters, complex parts could be produced.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Plastic-to-fuel (PTF) technology uses pyrolysis to convert plastic waste—especially non-recycled plastics (NRP)—into ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. To assess the potential energy and environmental benefits associated with PTF technology, we calculated the energy, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions of NRP-derived ULSD and compared the results to those metrics for conventional ULSD fuel. For these analyses, we used the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation (GREET®) model. Five companies provided pyrolysis process product yields and material and energy consumption data. Co-products of the process included char and fuel gas. Char can be landfilled, which, per the company responses, is the most common practice for this co-product, or it may be sold as an energy product. Fuel gas can be combusted to internally generate process heat and electricity. Sensitivity analyses investigated the influence of co-product handling methodology, product yield, electric grid composition, and assumed efficiency of char combustion technology on life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the GHG emissions would likely be reduced up to 14% when it is compared to conventional ULSD, depending on the co-product treatment method used. NRP-derived ULSD fuel could therefore be considered at a minimum carbon neutral with the potential to offer a modest GHG reduction. Furthermore, this waste-derived fuel had 58% lower water consumption and up to 96% lower fossil fuel consumption than conventional ULSD fuel in the base case. In addition to the comparison of PTF fuels with conventional transportation fuels, we also compare the results with alternative scenarios for managing NRP including power generation and landfilling in the United States.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a policy concept aimed at extending producers’ responsibility for their products to the post-consumer stage of their products’ lifecycle. This paper examines various approaches to implementing EPR for various types of packaging waste in South Africa, focusing in particular on their effectiveness in stimulating the recovery of post-consumer packaging material for recycling. In particular, the approaches adopted in the plastic bag, steel beverage can, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) industries are examined. It is found that voluntary industry initiatives (as in the can, glass and PET industries) can be effective in stimulating recovery in a developing country context. By contrast, in the South African case, mandatory, government-imposed regulations (as in the plastic bag industry) have not been effective in stimulating recovery. However, this does not imply that voluntary initiatives are always more effective than mandatory regulations. Instead, it is likely that the differing results for plastic bags as opposed to other packaging waste streams in South Africa can be explained by the differing characteristics of the former; in particular, their reusability (particularly for bin liners) and low recycling value relative to the other waste streams. In addition, in the case of glass and PET, a major incentive behind the voluntary initiatives was the desire to avoid punitive regulations like those imposed in the plastic bag industry. It could therefore be argued that mandatory regulations in the plastic bag industry had the indirect effect of stimulating recovery in the glass and PET industries.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The combustion of biomass and waste paper sludge in a fluidized bed is ecologically profitable. However, a large amount of by-product with high hydraulic reactivity is produced and is considered as wastes. Most of the time the waste paper fly ash (WPFA) goes to landfills, therefore new utilization methods are necessary. In some countries, the high content of metallic and metalloids trace elements (MMTE) in WPFA, more specifically Barium (Ba) and Lead (Pb) makes its valorization difficult. In this paper, the Lightweight Aggregates (LWA) was produced from WPFA by granulating with water in high-intensity granulator. Since WPFA is rich in CaO, the addition of water promotes rapid setting and hydration compared to other types of ash. In this study, different granulation parameters were investigated, such as the rotation modes between the steel pan and the impeller, the rotation speed of the steel pan, the granulation time, in order to improve the mass percentage of the targeted LWA (2–16 mm). In order to evolve the immobilization potential of Ba and Pb, a carbonation process was performed, exposing the manufactured LWA to pure carbon dioxide (CO2) gas at laboratory scale. The physical, morphological, thermal and mechanical characterizations were performed on LWA for use in mortars, concretes or civil engineering constructions. Results have demonstrated the influence of the rotation mode between the steel pan and the on the distribution of WPFA inside the steel pan and the change in the growth rate of the granules can be observed. Increased density and improved compressive strength with low porosity and water absorption were also found in LWA after carbonation. This was due to the occurrence of both a carbonation reaction and a hydration reaction. Furthermore, the results of thermogravimetry and SEM-EDS confirmed the formation of hydrated phases (ettringite, carboaluminates), also the formation of calcite in the pores and the external surface of the LWA. Regarding environmental aspects, the results have revealed that Ba and Pb were well immobilized in the solid matrix after carbonation.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This study presents the structure-property relationship of rotationally molded products made of waste-based polylactide (PLA) pre-processed with different procedures. While the use of recycled petrochemical thermoplastics, such as polyethylene, is a current industrial practice, there is no evidence of recycled, biodegradable polymers as a source of material for manufacturing the rotomolded parts. The main problem is the difficulty in grinding low-melting material with a high ability to degrade during the milling process into a powder, which is essential from the point of view of rotational molding. The work describes three types of polylactide pre-treatment from post-consumer disposable cups for applying powders and micropellet as a material for manufacturing rotationally molded purposes. The applied pre-treatments are annealing disposable cups for 24 h at 100 °C and melt processing by extrusion of previously shredded cups. As part of the conducted research, the influence of initial recrystallization of the polymeric material and the impact of additional melt processing on the geometric features of the charge materials and the degree of their degradation was assessed. Complete structural characteristics of particle-shaped materials (powders and micropellets) evaluated using spectroscopic and calorimetric methods (FTIR and DSC) were related to the structure of the final products assessed by the 3D computed tomography (CT) method and resulting mechanical properties. Based on the conducted analyses, the risks and potential paths of development of the technology of shaping rotomolded products with low porosity (void volume 0.53%) and favorable mechanical properties (tensile strength of 48 MPa), made of recycled, biodegradable polyesters, were shown.',\n",

The waste management of these materials is critical because most of the wastes produced are sent to landfills. This research intends to evaluate the influence of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) waste as a filler in cement-based mortars. The technical performance of the renders with GFRP was analysed in order to find a viable solution to recycle this waste. Two sets of mortars were analysed: mortars with a similar workability and mortars with the same water/binder ratio both with percentages of GFRP waste incorporation of 10%, 15%, 20% and 50%. The water behaviour was analysed through the water absorption by capillarity test and drying test. The mechanical behaviour was analysed through the dynamic modulus of elasticity, velocity of ultrasound waves, flexural strength and compressive strength. The incorporation of GFRP by-products in mortars is a viable solution for the reutilization of this waste. The GFRP waste improved the workability of the mortars and reduced their bulk density. The modified mortar with best technical performance was the mortar with 50% of GFRP by-product as substitute of natural aggregate. The initial water absorption of these mortar was reduced by over 80% (measured by the coefficient of capillarity) and the mechanical strength was significantly improved: at 365 days, there was an increase in flexural strength of 155% and in compressive strength of 166%.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recent progress in the recycling and recovery of polyurethane and polyurethane composites is reviewed. The various types of polyurethane waste products, consisting of either old recycled parts or production waste, are generally reduced to a more usable form, such as flakes, powder or pellets, depending on the particular type of polyurethane that is being recycled. The various recycling technologies for material and chemical recycling of PU materials have greatly contributed to improve the overall image regarding the recyclability of polyurethanes in recent years, by far the most important being regrinding and glycolysis. These technologies open an emerging, effective and economic route for recycling polyurethane rigid foams and composite. Polyurethane foam in automotive seating has been successfully recycled using regrind technology. Glycolysis of polyurethanes can be economically acceptable, but still requires more development in order to tolerate more contamination in the post-consumer material. Current technologies can recover the inherent energy value of polyurethanes and reduce fossil fuel consumption. Energy recovery is considered the only suitable disposal method for recovered material for which no markets exist or can be created. Increasing waste-to-energy and other thermal processing activities involving gasification, pyrolysis and two-stage combustion has contributed for the disposal of significant amounts of scrap PU without many difficulties. It is concluded that many of the plastic feedstock recycling processes appear to be technically feasible and robust enough to warrant further development in the future.',\n",

Its performance was compared with the batch microwave pyrolysis (BMP) under identical conditions. During the pyrolysis, the continuous-stirred system generated more condensate products with higher selectivity in long carbon chains (C14–C20), whereas the batch system was more selective for gas products with a higher proportion of methane. An ex-situ catalytic bed with HZSM-5 was assembled to upgrade pyrolysis vapors, corresponding to improved gasoline-range hydrocarbons and propylene production. The comparison of catalytic processes showed similar product yields for both configurations, with differences primarily on chemical species selectivity. For instance, the products from the continuous-stirred system had narrower carbon number distribution (C7–C10) and higher selectivity to mono-aromatics (72.3%). The proposed pathways for LLDPE conversion from the two systems showed slight differences in the thermal cracking process but similarities in the catalytic cracking process. During the catalytic processes, the potential net energy gain was 34.16 MJ/kg for CSMP and −38.86 MJ/kg for BMP, compared with the non-catalytic processes, when the figures were 9.85 MJ/kg and −42.86 MJ/kg, respectively.',\n",

Water absorption, solubility, tensile and biodegradation tests were carried out to determine physical and mechanical properties of studied biocomposites. Moreover, a direct test with plants was performed during summer months to evaluate the growth of pepper seedlings (C. baccatum) within the biocontainers. Results showed that gelatin-based biocomposites reached the higher solubility and water absorption. After 24 days, wheat- and corn-waste flour formulations biodegraded 28.5 and 27%, meanwhile, gelatin had the most decomposition rate (62%) and paper-based biocomposites, the least (25%). Gelatin based formulations supported the maximum load in tensile tests, although flexural tests showed that paper-based biocomposites are the most flexible. From the field test it was observed that gelatin biocontainers were almost degraded at the first week and also allowed the greatest plant development, acting as fertilizer, even better than the control plant. On the contrary, plant growth in biocontainers based on wheat- and corn-waste flour as well as paper was impeded since the low level of container decomposition. As a consequence, all formulations prepared have proved biodegradation. Gelatin-based containers could be considered as plantable, while the other ones must be considered as compostable.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Recent studies on utilization of recycled concrete have demonstrated that usually discarded finest fractions can be incorporated into cementitious composites without scarifying their structural performance. It has been shown that these fines can increase the resistance of a cementitious matrix to tensile stresses and reduce shrinkage, and that these effects can be boosted by addition of mineral admixtures. Such findings led us to a consideration that incorporating recycled concrete fines into a concrete mix could possibly mitigate aggregate-induced shrinkage cracking. Here, this hypothesis was put under scrutiny in a comprehensive experimental-numerical study, confirming that blending Portland cement with recycled concrete fines can mitigate inclusion-induced shrinkage cracking, especially when combined with fly ash. The results of coupled hygro-mechanical modeling indicate that incorporating recycled concrete fines leads not only to a decrease of shrinkage but also increases fracture energy and thus has a major impact on the reduction of micro-cracks between inclusions.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Environmentally friendly and cost-efficient recyclable demulsifiers are critical for dewatering of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions. Here, a novel facile synthesis of magnetic-recyclable demulsifiers is reported. Three kinds of commercial polyether demulsifiers (AE1910, SP169, and AR321) are used and anchored onto Fe3O4 nanoparticle surfaces using mussel-inspired polydopamine as an adhesive. Infrared spectra, transmission electron microscopy imaging, dynamic light scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction are employed. The results confirm successful polydopamine coating on nanoparticle surfaces (Fe3O4@PDA) and follow the binding of polyether demulsifiers (Fe3O4@PDA@AE1910). A water contact angle of 91.3° measured on Fe3O4@PDA@AE1910 indicates particle amphiphilicity for promising interfacial activity. A low interfacial tension (∼1.0 mN⋅ m−1) and a rapid adsorptive behavior are observed for the oil-water interface with the presence of Fe3O4@PDA@AE1910. The three kinds of nanoparticles report high demulsification efficiency of 98.00 %, 91.63 %, and 94.33 % for crude oil emulsions. They also record 98.25 %, 90.27 %, and 98.66 % for water/n-decane emulsions for Fe3O4@PDA@AE1910, Fe3O4@PDA@SP169, and Fe3O4@PDA@AR321, respectively. These nanoparticles can be magnetically recovered and reused. As high as 77.81 % remaining demulsification efficiency is reached after eight cycles of treating water/n-decane emulsion and three cycles of treating crude oil emulsions by using Fe3O4@PDA@AE1910. The findings indicate a promising application of polydopamine-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticle to prepare various magnetic recyclable nanoparticle demulsifiers in dewatering of W/O emulsions. Compared with previous reports, the synthetic process is simple, and the synthetic condition is temperate and environmentally friendly, which may advance the application of recyclable nano-demulsifiers in the oil field.',\n",

       " {'context': 'As a waste-to-resource strategy, solid waste-derived ceramic membranes have attracted growing research interests for various water treatment applications due to their low costs, renewable and sustainable features, and potentially high removal efficiencies for pollutants. However, waste-derived ceramic membranes still face some challenges, such as less controllable membrane structures and properties due to the varying compositions and impurities in the solid wastes. In addition, waste-derived ceramic membranes have often restricted applications for pharmaceutical, biotechnological, food and beverage products. In this critical review, the advantages of waste-derived ceramic membranes are highlighted in terms of their properties and material sources by comparing with conventional materials. We also analyze the key roles of different solid wastes and the parameters in fabricating ceramic membranes. Various water treatment applications of waste-derived ceramic membranes are summarized based on the separation mechanisms. Since the waste-derived ceramic membrane for water purification is an emerging technology, there are numerous opportunities in this exciting area. The directions for future research and development are recommended accordingly.

       " {'context': 'In Italy, most of the packaged food wasted during the distribution phase and at retail stores is disposed of in landfill, due to the absence of a sorting system able to separate food from packaging. A new experimental process, here presented, collects the packaged food waste from retailers, moves it to distribution centres, and then ships it to a sorting facility where the food is separated from its packaging. The sorted packaging materials are then sent to specific recycling or energy recovery centres, meaning that only a small amount of packaging material is disposed of in landfill. In this study, the environmental performance of this innovative process is compared with the impacts generated by disposal in landfill using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Data for the year 2015 in the Emilia Romagna region (Italy) was collated for this purpose; in this region, about 14,600 tons of food are wasted in the retail channel annually. The LCA is performed using the ReCiPe midpoint method; primary data was taken from the field, while secondary data came from literature and ecoinvent 3.3 databases. Three sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the results when the distances covered during the transport phase, the composition of the packaging waste, or the EOL of the country where the analysis is performed varied. Overall, the results show that the innovative scenario is more environmentally sound than the one currently in use. Taking into account the avoided impacts, the environmental impact turned out to be negative in all the categories, suggesting a beneficial effect on the environment.',\n",

       " {'context': \"Municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasingly considered a source of energy and materials rather than an environmental and socioeconomic problem. Incineration using the grate-firing technique is one of the best available technologies for thermal treatment of non-recyclable MSW with energy recovery. The transition to a circular economy brings a new challenge to the Waste to Energy (WtE) industry. Due to advanced waste management schemes, the calorific value of the input waste is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, WtE plant designers and operators have aimed to increase the energy and material recovery efficiency of their installations, while maintaining or even decreasing operation and maintenance costs. For these reasons, there is a need for better understanding of the chemical and physical phenomena involved in the MSW incineration process. Accurate numerical modelling of MSW packed bed combustion can substantially contribute to this objective. The literature on similar fields such as coal and biomass combustion has delineated many crucial aspects of modelling solid fuel combustion in grate-firing applications. However, the know-how obtained in these fields cannot be one on one transferred to MSW incineration because MSW is much more inhomogeneous in composition and thermophysical properties. This paper first presents an overview of MSW's chemical and thermophysical properties. Then, the heterogeneous nature of MSW and its complex thermal degradation behaviour are used as a basis to discuss the suitability of the available numerical methodologies. Finally, current challenges in the modelling of waste beds are identified, with relevance to improving the performance of industrial WtE plants.\",\n",

       " {'context': 'This review paper discusses the available literature on end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from a waste management standpoint. The amount of LIBs entering the waste stream has increased in recent years because of their growing prevalence in electronic devices and vehicles. The electric vehicle (EV) industry, in particular, is expected to create a high demand for LIBs and this paper has identified them as a major contributor to the LIB waste stream in the near future. Waste LIBs exhibit many hazardous characteristics, such as the ability to spontaneously ignite and/or release hazardous chemicals under landfill conditions. The authors review the current findings with regards to their hazardous properties and present potential solutions to help mitigate these problems. One major solution is to manage LIBs as a hazardous or universal waste, which would entail special regulations for this waste stream. While lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries are often regulated as a hazardous or universal waste, most countries, such as the U.S., currently manage LIBs as a general solid waste. However, it may be plausible to consider these types of batteries as a hazardous or universal waste because they have frequently exceeded federal and state regulatory thresholds for certain metals, such as lead. This paper also identifies recycling as another major solution for end-of-life LIB management. Based on life cycle impact assessment studies, recycling certain types of LIBs results in a lower resource depletion potential and less air emissions than a cradle-to-grave management scenario.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) may be pre-treated in a mechanical–biological treatment (MBT) plant to produce an exiting stream with improved combustible characteristics. The process also produces a second waste stream, which is generally separated on a size basis by industrial sieving equipment. It contains fractions with a high moisture content such as residual food waste, soiled paper and cardboard, and small fragments of other materials. Samples of this stream, collected at an existing plant, were characterized and processed by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) at laboratory scale, at various temperatures (180, 200 and 220 °C), reaction times (1, 4 and 8 h) and solid to water ratios (0.15 and 0.07). The primary energy balance, on a hypothetical industrial scale, was performed. In brief, the results confirmed that the produced hydrochar was a brittle, hydrophobic, solid carbonaceous product which gave a better combustion performance as the residence time of the HTC process was increased. Moreover, the dewaterability of the carbonized waste was greatly improved when compared to raw, wet samples. The results of the primary energy balance confirmed that the energy contained in the produced hydrochar was higher than the energy consumption for the process itself, under all the HTC working conditions. The energy consumed in the process was in the range of 40–70 % of the energy content of the produced hydrochar.',\n",

The morphology of PLA in both HDPE/PLA blends and HDPE/MCC fibres composites was irregular and immiscible. The tensile strength at max load and % elongation at break of all polyblend composites were reduced to ~17%, ~15%, and ~84%, ~89% than pure HDPE matrix, respectively. The toughness of HDPE and its polyblend composites were decreased to ~92% and ~91%, respectively. As higher number indicates greater resistance, the hardness of HDPE was improved by ~7% and ~10% after adding PLA followed by MCC fibres. As revealed from DSC analysis, the crystallinity of composites was considerably influenced by the MCC fibres content due to the transcrystallization effect. The crystallinity of HDPE/PLA with MCC fibres polyblend composites was decreased by ~41% as compared to the HDPE matrix because of disorientation of fibres as seen in X-ray diffraction analysis. Eventually, the results revealed that the presence or absence of MCC fibre loading had significant effects on the mechanical, morphological, and thermal properties of HDPE/PLA blends.',\n",

       " {'context': \"With the necessity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction as a backdrop, the circular economy (CE) is increasingly being considered an effective response to this issue. Currently, China is facing a considerable challenge as it tries to respond to Paris Agreement targets; however, in many respects China is ahead of other nations as it relates to the implementation of such innovative strategies such as the circular economy policies. For over ten years, China has been investigating how the circular economy policies could be used to respond to GHG emission issue. In particular, the effects of such economic development pattern needs to be identified as well as the specific influence on GHG emissions reduction. This study presents an analysis of the Chinese plastic recycling industries (CPRI) through this lens. Plastics were specifically targeted, as such waste generation represents one of the highest fractions of global waste by mass, as well as the increasing public concerns of the environmental impacts of post-consumer plastics waste. Integrating the concepts of circular economy in this industry could be deemed an effective strategy, one which not only reduces post-consumer waste pollution, but also mitigates GHG emissions. This study analyzes the trajectories, features and driving forces of GHG emissions reduction achieved by the CPRI in the past ten years. The results show that the contribution of the CPRI to [specifically] CO2 emissions reduction increased from 7.67 million tons (MT) in 2007 to 14.57\\u202fMT in 2016; the scale factor and structure factor had significant impacts on GHG emissions reduction changes. A scenario analysis is presented based on projected impacts of various relevant national strategies. Finally, the policy implications of the CPRI's further GHG reduction measures are proposed.\",\n",

Hereby recycling quotas are enforced to pave the way towards a closed loop recycling. During its lifetime, polymers are exposed to multiple environmental factors, which can already induce degradation. However, a major factor that needs to be taken into account is the increased thermo-mechanical stress during the recycling process, which may have significant impact on the quality of recyclates as well. In the present work, polyolefins (high-density polyethylene and polypropylene) were artificially exposed to stress by continuous extrusion at varying speeds and absence or presence of stabilizers to analyze the extent to which the recycling contributes to degradation processes. These samples were analyzed for low-molecular-weight stress markers by thermodesorption gas chromatography and by high-performance liquid chromatography (both coupled to mass spectrometric detection). Depending on the extent of stress, the occurrence of odd-numbered linear alkane chains was revealed in polyethylene samples, and of oxidized branched alkanes in polypropylene samples. Correlations with molecular weight (determined by high temperature gel permeation chromatography) and with decreasing concentrations of stabilizers could be demonstrated.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper is focused on the new method of waste processing. The waste, including hazardous waste, contain organic compounds. The method consists in two main processes: the pyrolysis of waste and the oxidation of the pyrolytic gas with a use of non-equilibrium plasma. The practical implementation of the method requires the design, construction and testing of the new device in large laboratory scale. The experiments were carried out for the two kinds of waste: polyethylene as a model waste and the electronic waste as a real waste. The process of polyethylene decomposition showed that the operation of the device is correct because 99.74% of carbon moles contained in the PE samples was detected in the gas after the process. Thus, the PE samples practically were pyrolyzed completely to hydrocarbons, which were completely oxidized in the plasma reactor. It turned out that the device is useful for decomposition of the electronic waste. The conditions in the plasma reactor during the oxidation process of the pyrolysis products did not promote the formation of PCDD/Fs despite the presence of the oxidizing conditions. An important parameter determining the efficiency of the oxidation of the pyrolysis products is gas temperature in the plasma reactor.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The pyrolysis of waste plastics (so called chemical recycling) is one perspective way of their utilizations, but the end product properties are a key point of the industrial leading of processes. In this paper a pilot scale pyrolysis process has been investigated. Waste plastics were decomposed in a tube reactor at 520 °C, using hourly feed rate of 9.0 kg. Raw materials were selectively collected wastes from agricultural and packaging industry. For supporting the more intensive cracking of CC bonds of main polymer structure a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst was tested in concentration of 5.0%. Products were separated into gases, gasoline, light and heavy oil by distillation. Plastic wastes could be converted into gasoline and light oil with yields of 20–48% and 17–36% depending on the used parameters. The gas and liquid products had significant content of unsaturated hydrocarbons, principally olefins. In the presence of ZSM-5 catalyst the yields of lighter fractions (especially gasoline) could be considerably increased and the average molecular weight of each fraction has decreased. Gasoline had C5–C15 hydrocarbons, while light oil had C12–C28. The used catalyst has promoted the formation of i-butane in gases and affected the composition of both gasoline and light oil. Properties of products are advantageous for fuel-like applications, and they are able to increase the productivity of refinery. On the other hand the possibility for further utilization of products from pyrolysis basically was affected by the source and the properties of raw materials. Waste polyethylene from agricultural consisted of some elements from fertilizers (N, S, P and Ca), which could not be removed from the surfaces of raw materials by pre-treatment (e.g. washing). In that case significant concentration of N, S, P and Ca can be measured in all products, but the catalyst has decreased the concentration of impurities. Gasoline, light oil and heavy oil were nitrogen free and sulphur content was below 12 mg/kg in hydrocarbons obtained by the pyrolysis of polypropylene waste from packaging.',\n",

Reutilization of plastic wastes is in favor of energy conservation and emission reduction, thereby is a significant pathway of plastic wastes disposal. Carbonization is an effective way of converting polymer precursors to valuable carbon materials for use in fields of energy conversion and storage, environmental protection and restoration. Here, we present a systematic multi-perspective overview of carbonization as a feasible route of reutilization of plastic wastes. A brief summary of conventional routes for plastic wastes is followed by a brief introduction of carbonization for converting plastics to carbon materials. Special emphasis is paid on the carbonization pathways and mechanisms of common plastics. Finally, the feasibility, application prospect and challenge of carbonization as one method of reutilization of plastic wastes are proposed. By presenting a consolidated information source on different carbonization mechanisms, this review provides a valuable guideline for reutilization of plastic wastes by carbonization.',\n",

       " {'context': 'In the last 20 years, it has become apparent that waste produced from plastics was becoming an environmental problem because of their low biodegradability. Though several methods have been proposed for recycling waste plastics, it is generally accepted that material recovery is not a long-term solution to the present problem, and that energy or chemical recovery is a more attractive alternative, including cracking into the monomer constituents, combustion to produce energy, and thermal or catalytic conversion to produce useful intermediate chemicals. This paper is a contribution in the area of the last option for energy recovery. There have been a number of publications reporting the use of molecular sieves and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts for the cracking of polymers into a range of hydrocarbons. The research work reported here demonstrates the ability of mesoporous catalysts in cracking polyethylene into gasoline range products. It was found that for mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts, its cracking activity increases with its crystallinity, displaying higher activity with smaller pore diameters. The hydrocarbon product distribution strongly indicates a carbenium ion cracking mechanism. The product distribution was also compared with those obtained from thermal cracking tests.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Microplastics (MPs) pollution has been recognized as a threat to sustainable fisheries due to the risks of MPs contamination in the process of feed production and susceptibility of fish to ingest MPs from the aquatic environment. In this study, we applied comprehensive approaches to investigate the impacts of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) on juvenile genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus) through 9-week dietary exposure based on growth performance, gut microbiota, liver metabolism, and gene expressions in brain and liver tissues. Dietary exposure to two kinds of PE-MPs with different median size (27 μm and 63 μm, respectively) concentration-dependently decreased weight gain (WG), while increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of the tilapia. Dietary administration of PE-MPs also significantly reduced the activities of intestinal protease and amylase. PE-MPs particles of the larger size groups (63 μm) were mainly detected in feces, but those of the smaller ones (27 μm) tended to be accumulated in intestine. PE-MPs ingestion resulted in the alteration of gut microbiota composition, with Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes as the overrepresented bacterial taxa. Metabolomic assays of liver samples in fish fed the diets containing 8 % of PE-MPs revealed the particle size-specific variations in composition of differential metabolites and metabolism pathways such as amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Gene expressions of brain and liver samples were analyzed by RNA-seq. Photoperiodism and circadian rhythm were the representative biological processes enriched for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from the brain. Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) was the most enriched pathway revealed by a joint transcriptomic and metabolic pathway analysis for the liver, followed by propanoate and pyruvate metabolism. Furthermore, an integration analysis of the gut microbiome and liver transcriptome data identified significant associations between several pathogenic bacteria taxa and immune pathways. Our findings demonstrated that the sizes and concentrations of PE-MPs are critically related to their toxic impacts on microbiota community, metabolism, gene expressions and thus fish growth.',\n",

       " {'context': 'This paper discusses the influence of low content red fibers on the mechanical characteristics of recycled HDPE composites. Composites of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and common reed (Phragmite australis) natural fibers were prepared by successive single screw extrusion blending. The mechanical and thermal properties of these composites which have low concentrations of fibers were investigated. It was found that the number of extrusions had no effect on the thermal stability of composites, even if the presence of fibers may be accelerating the degradation of the polymer matrix. Moreover, rheological measurements showed a decrease in the viscosity of the neat matrix, while the opposite was observed in composites for which the highest viscosity is obtained after five cycles of extrusion. These results suggest a decrease in the molecular weight of the HDPE during reprocessing. For composites, however, a good dispersion of the RF matrix was obtained, which increased as the number of extrusions grew larger. As for the mechanical properties, a substantial enhancement in ductility was observed, as compared to that of neat recycled matrices, when small RF concentrations were added. Thus, for 2.6% RF the best enhancement of ductility was obtained with the conservation of the fiber length and a good dispersion of fibers. These findings show that incorporating low contents of reed fibers can be an interesting solution when trying to improve the mechanical behavior of recycled polyethylene.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Converting plastic wastes into value-added products through energy-efficient pyrolysis is essential, and it requires lower pyrolysis temperatures and shorter processing times than that of other processes. An exothermic phenomenon was observed during the process high-pressure polyethylene pyrolysis. It was proven for the first time that the exotherm is caused by a pressure-induced phase transition, in which colossal heat release can be driven by relatively small pressures. A large temperature change (> 100 °C) leads to the deep cracking of polyethylene, although the set temperature is far lower than the required temperature for thermal cracking. Importantly, the heat input stops immediately when the set temperature is reached; thus, the external heating time is short. Polyethylene can be completely converted into liquid products in ~90 wt% yield and with a small number of gases. The self-exothermic phase transition only occurs within a certain range of material thickness, which is related to the corresponding phase behavior. In the self-exothermic pyrolysis process, with an increase in the thickness of polyethylene, the proportion of low-value olefins in oil products decreases gradually, while alkanes, isoalkanes and aromatics show an increasing trend, making the product composition closer to the fuel standard. This work provides a viable approach for plastic recycling at low pyrolysis temperatures and short external heating times with the help of a self-exothermic phase transition in the absence of a catalyst.',\n",

To increase the yield of volatile and to improve the product properties (e.g. reduced chlorine content, better storage and transportation) red mud, calcium hydroxide, and nickel loaded zeolite catalysts were used. The nickel loaded synthetic zeolite catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. Catalysts with high synthetic zeolite content can increase the yields of light oil roughly by 50%. The char formation was slight under the same used conditions. In case of catalyst free pyrolysis, the gases and light oil contained significant amount of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can occur further corrosion problems. The stability of light oil was followed by aging test. Slight formations of polymerized compounds from unsaturated hydrocarbons were found after the treating in case of catalytic pyrolysis. However, the total acidic number was moderate-high without catalyst. Regarding the catalysts, the concentration of chlorinated compounds can be drastically reduced in the presence of catalysts. Especially, when high ratios of the red mud and calcium hydroxide were used. Therefore, the total acid number could be also reduced. Higher synthetic zeolite ratio in the catalyst mixture led to favorable hydrocarbon composition of products, e.g. higher concentration of branched compounds or lower C/H ratio.',\n",

This biochar was first purposed for the upgrading of the biogas from the said anaerobic digestion, before treating and recovering the nutrients in the solid fraction of the digestate, which was finally employed as a biofertilizer for the organic cultivation of three green leafy vegetables: kale, lettuce and rocket salad. Whilst the amount of CO2 the biochar could absorb from the biogas was low (11.17 mg g−1), it could potentially be increased by modifying through physical and chemical methods. Virgin as well as CO2-laden biochar were able to remove around 31% of chemical oxygen demand, 8% of the ammonia and almost 90% of the total suspended solids from the digestate wastewater, which was better than a dewatering process via centrifugation but worse than the industry standard of a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane bioreactor. Nutrients were recovered in the solid fraction of the digestate residue filtered by the biochar, and utilised as a biofertilizer that performed similarly to a commercial complete fertilizer in terms of aerial fresh weight growth for all three vegetables cultivated.

       " {'context': 'Recycling technology is widely used in the asphalt road construction due to its environmental and economic effects. Many efforts have focused on the performance restoration of aged base asphalt by adding light oil, but the possibility of recycling the aged asphalt using low-viscosity asphalt and polymers has been few explored. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use polymer-modified low-viscosity asphalt as rejuvenator to recycle the aged asphalt. The conventional properties, rheological behaviors as well as anti-aging performance of polymer-modified recycled asphalts were evaluated by rotational viscosity (RV) tests, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests and bending beam rheometer (BBR) tests. Moreover, the effects of the concentration ratio between polymer-modified low-viscosity asphalt rejuvenator and aged asphalt on the high-temperature anti-rutting, low-temperature cracking resistance, fatigue and aging resistance abilities of recycled asphalt were studied. The results show that the low-viscosity asphalt can increase viscous components and restore the workability of aged asphalt. However, the addition of low-viscosity asphalt weakens the high-temperature properties, temperature sensitivity and anti-aging performance of aged asphalt. Fortunately, the high-temperature rutting resistance, temperature sensitivity, viscoelastic properties, low-temperature cracking resistance, anti-fatigue and aging resistance performance of recycled asphalt can be enhanced remarkably by adding SBS and CR. Meanwhile, SBS-modified recycled asphalt has better fatigue and low temperature cracking resistance properties, while CR-modified recycled asphalt has the advantages on the rutting resistance, anti-aging and temperature sensitivity performance. Furthermore, SBS5-5 and CR6-4 modified recycled asphalts both have better pavement performance than others, which is superior to the requirements of polymer modified asphalt. Therefore, it is meaningful and feasible to recycle the aged base asphalt to be polymer-modified asphalt.',\n",

       " {'context': '               The lack of or slow natural environmental decomposition, enhanced by the increasing production and consumption of polymeric materials, is an important barrier to the progress of today’s civilization. Today, recycling of plastics has become paramount in preserving the environment. The material recycling consisting of reutilization of postindustrial polymeric materials, and their return to industry, could be an appropriate way of solving environmental concerns, proposing low-cost recycled resources. It seems that the addition of other components to the waste polymers is the simplest and easiest approach for reusing the recycled polymers. In fact, more excellent feature for improvement of all mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties will be obtained in the presence of nanofillers. The main goal of emerging composites from recycled plastics is to decrease resource consumption, direct and indirect emissions and to fabricate the product “Greener” than the conventional product meeting the same functional criteria. In this chapter, the ability of recycled polymers both as filler and matrix of composites as well as their properties and applications has been discussed.            ',\n",

The milling process is required in the production of CDW-based precursor. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of milling duration on CDW-based precursors and resulting geopolymer paste. Results show that prolonged milling enhances the reactivity of CDW precursors by changing the particle size, crystal structures and surface group. A longer milling duration promotes the formation of the Si-rich gel, resulting in a higher reaction degree and a more densely packed structure of CDW-based geopolymer. Benefiting from the higher strength, geopolymer derived from CDW with longer milling can achieve a lower CO2 emission per unit strength. However, the reactivity enhancement of CDW became less apparent with the increasing milling duration since the particle aggregation and activated phases on the surface could prevent further activation. The milling for CDW-based precursor production is suggested to be appropriately prolonged but not exceed 2 h.',\n",

Twenty-eight unknown compounds were tentatively identified using very restrictive criteria that includes exact mass, isotopic profile, MS2 match, retention time and MS3 match. Most of the identified compounds were additives, mainly plasticizers, used in different plastic applications. To check for the safety of the migration of these compounds for food contact material applications of the LDPE recycled plastic, a risk assessment was performed using mainly the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach.

The larvae maintained high survival rates and low cannibal rates, but their body fat content decreased when fed with PS or LDPE with respective consumption rates of 43.3 ± 1.5 and 52.9 ± 3.1 mg plastics/100 larvae per day. The larvae biodegraded PS via broad depolymerization and LDPE via limited-extent depolymerization. The ingested PS and LDPE were fragmented into microplastics with a mean size of 174 and 185 μm on a volume basis, and the particles with a size of 6.3 and 5.9 μm reached a maximum number, respectively, with no nanoplastics generated. Chemical modifications of the polymers were confirmed. Significant shifts and clustering in the gut microbiota were detected with the relative abundance of Citrobacter sp. increasing when PS and LDPE were fed, as reported for other species of Tenebrionidae. Microbial functional enzymes, possibly associated with plastic degradation, including arylesterase and serine-hydrolase, were upregulated in both PS-fed and PE-fed larvae. This work provides new insights into insect-mediated biodegradation of persistent plastics for future investigations.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The focus of the present study is to improve the engineering behavior of Clays belonging to Upper Siwalik Formation and located in the sub-tropical zone with average annual rainfall of 297 mm. The presence of shear zones and random fissures in these over consolidated and slicken sided clays pose serviceability problems like differential settlement, pavement defects and excessive erosion resulting into the massive loss of property. Suitability assessment of industrial waste glass powder (IWGP) to address the issue could be twofold beneficial: potential solution of the problem; and economical utilization of waste leading to clean environment. The IWGP ranging from 5% to 20% to the air-dried mass of base soil was used to evaluate its impact on various properties. Laboratory testing including grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, compaction characteristics, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), California bearing ratio (CBR) for un-soaked and soaked conditions and swell potential of the control and clay samples was conducted. As no chemical reaction (hydration) was expected between soil and IWGP, curing of samples was not considered. The test results showed that addition of 20% IWGP showed maximum improvement in the UCS (110%), un-soaked (67%) and soaked (300%) CBR values. On the other hand, 26% reduction in swelling strain at 1kPa effective vertical stresses was also observed with this combination. The capital cost analysis for one-kilometer dual carriageway, for all combinations of soil and IWGP, showed that 15% dosage was the optimum quantity providing adequate strength enhancement (54.5%) with substantial reduction of 19% in capital cost. Besides, it poses very low environmental risk for nearby aqueous media. Consequently, IWGP has been assessed as a sustainable modifier for improvement of Siwalik Clay leading to potential solution for serviceability problems.',\n",

HDPE has many engineering applications in different industries such as piping systems, cable and wiring, automotive parts, storage containers, and biomedical implants. The temperatures chosen were 23, 53, and 82 °C based on the service temperature range for application in design of automotive fuel tanks. Creep strength decreased and creep strain as well as creep strain rate increased by increasing temperature. The Larson-Miller parameter widely used for metallic materials was able to correlate time to rupture, stress, and temperature data of HDPE. The Monkman-Grant relation was successfully used to correlate minimum creep rate and time to rupture. The Findley power law and time-stress superposition principle (TSS) were used to represent nonlinear viscoelastic creep curves. Some longer-term creep tests were also conducted at room temperature to evaluate the accuracy of extrapolation of the short-term creep test results to longer creep life predictions. The models used based on the data presented can be used in the design of parts and components made of HDPE where creep failure may be a concern.',\n",

       "'We study the synthesis of MWCNTs using polypropylene waste as a precursor and Ni/Mo/MgO as a catalyst by the combustion technique. Molar ratios of Ni, Mo and MgO in the Ni/Mo/MgO catalyst were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) to obtain the maximum yield of CNTs. The mole ratio 4/0.2/1 was found to yield more carbon product. Further, process parameters such as combustion temperature, combustion time, polymer and catalyst weight were optimized by RSM using Box–Behnken three-level and four-factorial design. The best possible combination of process parameters (combustion time of 10min, combustion temperature of 800°C, polymer weight of 5g and catalyst weight of 150mg) for maximum yield of CNTs was obtained. HRTEM indicates that the diameter of CNTs depends on the catalyst composition used for the synthesis of CNTs. The results of the study indicate a facile method for producing CNTs from polypropylene waste.'"

      "In Bangladesh, as with many countries, the spread of COVID-19 made the wearing of single-use face masks, a non-pharmaceutical intervention to reduce viral transmission, surge in popularity amongst the general population. Consequently, irresponsible discarding of used masks into the environment, and mismanagement of the waste they produce, is potentially placing a large pollution burden on aquatic ecosystems in the country. Slow degradation of mask-derived polypropylene and polyethylene fibres creates large reservoirs of microplastic pollutants and these have acute and chronic effects on aquatic organism physiology. Using literature reviews, extrapolation of published data, and field observations, we present an emerging issue of pollution from COVID-19 personal protective equipment such as face masks in Bangladesh. We have estimated the volume of waste generated and document the potential consequences of its improper disposal, and subsequent degradation, in aquaculture ponds within country. In a field survey of 30 ponds in the Muktagacha upazilla, 76.7% were found to have plastics in contact with the water, or within 1m of the pond, and there was an average of 63 pieces of macro-plastic pollution per 5m2. This included floating discarded face masks. Bangladesh has a rich freshwater and marine resource which it depends upon for export trade, nutrition of the population, and jobs. To mitigate potential acute and chronic impacts on aquaculture and the environment, recommendations are made that, if adopted, would reduce entry of microplastics into the aquatic environments via face mask waste mismanagement.\n"

       "'[CLS] we study the synthesis of mwcnts using polypropylene waste as a precursor and ni / mo / mgo as a catalyst by the combustion technique. molar ratios of ni, mo and mgo in the ni / mo / mgo catalyst were optimized using response surface methodology ( rsm ) to obtain the maximum yield of cnts. the mole ratio 4 / 0. 2 / 1 was found to yield more carbon product. further, process parameters such as combustion temperature, combustion time, polymer and catalyst weight were optimized by rsm using box – behnken three - level and four - factorial design. the best possible combination of process parameters ( combustion time of 10min, combustion temperature of 800°c, polymer weight of 5g and catalyst weight of 150mg ) for maximum yield of cnts was obtained. hrtem indicates that the diameter of cnts depends on the catalyst composition used for the synthesis of cnts. the results of the study indicate a facile method for producing cnts from polypropylene waste.

    "# context = ['A new reactor system was developed for recovery fuels from the waste plastic mixture in steam atmosphere. Firstly, the degradation mechanisms of eight kinds of plastics, two polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene), two polyamide resins (nylon-6 and nylon-6,6), polystyrene and three polyesters (polycarbonate, poly(butylene terephthalate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate), were investigated both in nitrogen and steam as the carrier gas. Plastics except for polyesters were degraded without any influences of the kinds of the carrier gas, leaving negligibly small amount of carbonaceous residue. Polyesters, which were degraded with producing large amount of the residue in nitrogen, were succeeded to be hydrolyzed at high reaction rates in steam with producing hardly the carbonaceous residue. Secondly, a mixture of the waste plastics was continuously degraded to produce heavy oil in steam atmosphere by using a new reactor system. This system was composed of three kinds of reactors connected in series. One was a reactor filled with stirred heat medium particles, which enabled the high heat transfer rate, the high holdup and the good contact of the melted plastics with steam. The second was a tank reactor. The last one was a fixed bed reactor with FeOOH catalyst particles, which showed the catalysis in steam for the decomposition both of a wax and sublimate materials generated by the degradation of plastics. Furthermore, the oil produced from the proposed reactor system was continuously upgraded to produce gasoline and kerosene over Ni-REY catalyst in steam atmosphere.']\n",
