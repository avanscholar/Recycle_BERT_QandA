      "Recovering waste plastics by catalytic fast pyrolysis to selectively generate aromatic hydrocarbons is a promising approach to dispose of solid wastes. In the present work, catalytic conversion of polystyrene over ultra-stable Y zeolites (USY) was conducted to directionally produce benzene and ethylbenzene. Experimental results indicated that catalyst type considerably affected the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and USY with high surface area (734 m2/g), large pore size (5.6 nm), and an abundant amount of strong acid sites (1.21 mmol/g) exhibited the most effective shape selectivity for ethylbenzene and benzene generation as the yield enhanced rate reached 401.8% and 61.1%, respectively. Plastic type also played a vital role in the formation of desirable aromatic hydrocarbons, and polystyrene was more beneficial to the production of ethylbenzene as a 54-fold increase was obtained compared to polycarbonate in the catalytic degradation process. Concerning reaction conditions to maximize the formation of benzene and ethylbenzene in the catalytic decomposition of polystyrene, the catalyst/feedstock mass ratio, Si/Al mole ratio in USY, and catalytic conversion temperature could be optimized at 1.5, 5.3, and 650 °C, respectively.\n"

By modulating the catalyst properties and operating conditions, it is possible to direct the product distribution to obtain oils that may be suitable both as fuels and as chemicals. However, the efficient and safe removal of the halogens, often contained in plastic wastes, remains as a great challenge. In this work, the catalytic behaviour of ZSM - 5 zeolites in the pyrolysis of a real chlorinated plastic waste of the electric and electronic equipment sector ( WEEE ), consisting of PE with about 3. 4 % of PVC, was investigated. To that end, three zeolite samples with different acidity and accessibility were synthesized and assayed. A thermal']\n",

In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high - value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron ( III ) chloride. The iron ( III ) - tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono - and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton - type radical oxidation reactions.

The iron ( III ) - tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min.

       "{'context': 'In this work, a hibonite-type Ni/La-hexaaluminate (Ni/LHA) synthesized from an industrial waste is used and compared as catalyst in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 973 K. The structure, catalytic behavior, and stability during a run time of at least 50 h of three Ni-catalysts obtained from two commercial supports and two preparation methods were used for comparison. An aluminum solution (9.40 g/L) obtained from an aluminum saline slag waste by acid extraction was used to synthesize the hexaaluminate by mixing with a stoichiometric amount of lanthanum nitrate and methanol/Peg400/PegMn400 under hydrothermal conditions at 493 K for 16 h. The Ni/LHA catalyst (10 wt% NiO) was obtained by impregnation of the synthesized support, calcined previously at 1473 K for 2 h. The resulting solids were characterized by several techniques as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption at 77 K, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). In order to compare the catalytic behavior and properties of the Ni/LHA catalyst, three Ni catalysts obtained from two commercial supports (γ-Al2O3 and SiO2) and two preparation methods (wet impregnation (I) and precipitation-deposition (PD)) were synthesized. Analysis of the TPR patterns for the catalysts allowed the type of metal support interaction and NiO species to be determined, with a weak interaction with the support being observed in Ni/LHA and Ni–I/SiO2. The NiO species observed, with crystallite sizes between 9.7 and 40.4 nm, confirm the X-ray structural analyses. The Ni/LHA catalyst was found to be active and very stable in the DRM reaction after 50 h. The catalytic behavior was evaluated from the CO2 and CH4 conversions, as well as the H2/CO selectivity, with values of 99% over almost all the time range evaluated. The behavior of this catalyst is comparable to that of Ni–I/Al2O3 and Ni-PD/SiO2. The results found indicating that the strong interaction of nickel with the support favors the stability of the catalysts in the DRM reaction.',\n",

      "Prediction: thermal energy should be of great importance in alleviating energy crisis. herein, we reported the fabrication of superwetting polypropylene ( pp ) aerogel as the support materials for construction of form - stable phase change materials ( pcms ) composites. due to its abundant porosity, light weight of aerogel in nature, inherent superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties, lipophilic organic pcms can be loaded into pp aerogel ( pp / pcm ) with a high pcms loading of up to 1060wt %, which is nearly two orders of magnitudes higher than those mostly reported form - stable pcms systems. the pp / pcm composites show high latent heat in the range of 141. 1kjkg−1 to 159. 5kjkg−1 and excellent thermal stability and recyclability where their latent heat nearly remains unchanged even after 50 times of melting / freezing cycles. results obtained from the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) show that the incorporation of organic pcms into pp aerogel network decreases the crystal size of pcms in the composites. more interestingly, the pp / pcm composites show an enhanced thermal conductivity\n",
