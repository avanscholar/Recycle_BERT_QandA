[{"context": "Bioethanol was produced from wheat straw by a concentrated alkali pretreatment at specific conditions with a yield of 88 g ethanol per 1 kg of dry straw. To economically improve the bioethanol production process and valorize residual waste, the lignin-rich solid waste particles were isolated from the pretreatment waste liquid and characterized, and finally employed to reinforce starch-based biodegradable film. The solid waste particles were characterized by chemical analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As bioethanol byproducts, they have mainly contained 88 wt% lignin. The average diameter of the uniform spherical shape extracted particles was determined to be 160 nm by DLS and FESEM. The presence of syringyl and guaiacyl rings were conducted by FTIR. Due to their suitable mechanical performance and thermal resistance, the lignin nanoparticles were employed as reinforcement for green biodegradable starch films. To prepare films, suspensions containing starch, glycerol, and different concentrations of lignin (0\u201330 wt%) were molded by the solution casting process. The starch-lignin composite films were analyzed by mechanical tensile tests, crystallinity analysis, FESEM, and thermal analysis. From the results, it was found that by adding 20 wt% lignin particles, the tensile strength and modulus of the pure starch film were increased from 4.8 and 0.9\u20138 and 2.4 MPa which can be partially explained due to crystallinity enhancement of film from 29 % to 48.3 %. In addition, the thermal resistance and the hydrophilic property of the composite films were enhanced due to lignin nanoparticle presence. It can be concluded that the isolation of lignin nanoparticles as waste solid in bioethanol production could be considered as a promising stage in the sustainability of second-generation products from the bioethanol production process.", "qas": [{"id": "13931", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "bioethanol production process", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "bioethanol byproducts", "answer_start": 696}, {"text": "bioethanol production", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "second-generation products", "answer_start": 1971}]}]}, {"context": "The current scenario of environment urgently needs alternative biologically synthesized fuels, value-added products, and preparation of catalyst to create a pollution free environment.

The evaluation of a material's greenness is based on criteria, such as whether the material is renewable and resource-efficient in its manufacture, installation, use, and disposal. A materials and resources prerequisite in most of the LEED\u2122 rating system categories is storage and collection of recyclables. The chapter reviews low-emitting materials: adhesives, finishes, and sealants. According to LEED\u2122, the intent of using rapidly renewable materials is to reduce the use and depletion of finite raw materials and long-cycle renewable materials by replacing them with rapidly renewable materials. Some of the commonly used rapidly renewable materials are bamboo and cork. One needs to consider many factors while using or selecting green office equipment, such as, durability, the ENERGY STAR\u00ae label, use of least energy and/or water. The chapter concludes with the concept of life-cycle assessment of building materials and products.

Shredder residue (SR) consists of glass, rubber, plastics, fibers, dirt, and fines that remain after ferrous and non-ferrous metals have been removed. Over 3 million tonnes of SR generated in the US each year are landfilled. The results of a previous end-of-life impact assessment showed that use of SR as a fuel supplement for cement manufacturing was environmentally beneficial to the current practice of landfilling and appears better in comparison to the other management methods studied. However, because many reuse and recycling options may not be cost effective, there is a need for further study. Simplistic methods to separate SR into energy and mineral rich streams may facilitate the use of a sizable fraction of SR. Due to the large scale of the cement industry in the US, a significant amount of SR is recoverable. The goal of this study was to identify the feedstock quality parameters needed to satisfy kiln operators and then to assess the mechanical means necessary to process SR into material acceptable as coal and mineral substitutes. Field tests were conducted to separate and beneficiate the coarse SR waste stream. Density separation techniques commonly used by shredders in the past were tested to separate rubber and plastics from non-combustibles and contaminants (e.g., PVC and copper wire). A fraction constituting about 30wt% of the total SR had fuel characteristics mirroring those of coal. However, remaining levels of potentially problematic constituents (e.g., total chlorine and heavy metals) may limit use to a low relative addition rate at some kilns. An economic review of a full-scale separation system showed that processing SR appears to be economically marginal considering avoided landfilling costs alone. However, significant economic benefits would result from additional non-ferrous metals recovery (namely copper). The project results showed that commonly available separation systems should produce an acceptable fuel supplement; however, regulatory barriers which inhibit economically viable recycling may need to be addressed.", "qas": [{"id": "14200", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "fibers", "answer_start": 187}, {"text": "energy mineral rich streams", "answer_start": 2203}]}]}, {"context": "Increasing concern for sustainability compels citizens and enterprises to reduce waste and encourage recycling, reuse and remanufacturing of end-of-life products.

MPs are carriers of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and can be transmitted along the food chains simply by ingestion of organisms. A continuously increasing number of researches about MPs have been reported during the last decade, indicating the importance of this field.

In this review, very recent progresses of degrading MPs by either biodegradation or catalytic-chemical degradation are summarized.

The accumulated waste plastics in the environment can be furtherly degraded into small pieces such microplastics and nanoplastics through weathering, which will do more harm to the environment and humans than large plastics. Therefore, plastic production and disposal are needed to be considered. Biodegradable plastics (BPs) have become the focus of recent research due to their potential biodegradability and harmlessness, which would be the most effective approach to manage the issue of plastic waste environmental accumulation. However, in the long run, it is uncertain whether BPs can be a promising solution to waste disposal and global plastic pollution. Consequently, both sides of the dispute are discussed in this paper. At present, most conventional plastics can not be replaced by theses BPs. Biodegradation of BPs needs certain environmental conditions, which are not always reliable in the environment. Additionally, changes in human behavioral awareness will also affect the development and application of BPs. BPs should not be considered as a technical solution, thus excusing our environmental responsibility, because littering does not change with the promotion of an effective technology. As such, the conclusion is that BPs may be a part of the solution.

This study tackled the ecodesign of a clam shell for packaging applications based on a novel ML film made of PLA and thermoplastic starch (TPS), evaluating the environmental performance of different design concepts through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In order to assure proper compatibility between PLA and TPS, the use of dielectric barrier discharge (dbd) plasma technology at atmospheric pressure to increase the hydrophilicity of PLA was investigated.

Despite the contribution of the PLA end-of-life phase to the overall environmental impact of the ML clam shell is low, the methodological approach to end-of-life can have a significant influence on the LCA results.

The promotion of high recovery and recycling rates should therefore be a priority in the future.

It captures the emerging area of biodegradable low carbon polymers from renewable resources with an emphasis on technical and environmental advantages that contribute to the reduction in carbon footprints. Research carried out from a sustainability standpoint by considering CO2 emissions right from production stage to end-of-life that helps in achieving a low carbon economy is reviewed. Some challenges that need to be addressed for future work, the potential role of sustainability analysis in enhancing the use of biopolymers are summarized.

The choice of suitable materials represents a considerable challenge for enhancing thermal comfort in buildings. In the present study, new composite samples based on locally available materials are manufactured and experimentally evaluated in order to obtain low-cost ecological materials with better thermo-physical properties. The composites are intended to be used in building walls. They are mainly cement-stabilized red clays (CSRC) with incorporation of different kind of natural and industrial insulators. Red clay is presented as material with high thermal performance. Natural wastes are of great importance owing to their low-cost and environment-friendly nature. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity measurements are carried out using Hot Disk thermal analyzer. Combined with the density data, thermal capacity is calculated. The results of the investigation show that the thermal performance of a building material can be improved by using red clay as basic material instead of sand, and incorporating thermal insulators. The thermal conductivity of cement-stabilized sand (0.934\u202fW/m\u202fK) is greater than cement-stabilized clay (0.591\u202fW/m\u202fK), which becomes lower when incorporating polystyrene (0.591\u202fW/m\u202fK). The CSRC incorporating sawdust, petiole, straw, Argan shell, and palm fibers offer interesting thermal performance in comparison to ordinary concretes, with an average thermal capacity and conductivity of respectively 1120\u202fkJ/m3 K and 0.43\u202fW/m\u202fK. Additionally, it is revealed that the thermal conductivity is mostly affected by cement content, humidity and temperature. By varying the cement content of stabilized clay (from 5% to 20%), the thermal conductivity increases by about 39%. For an average water content ranging between 1.2% and 12.9%, it increases by 74%.

To make the producer fee capable of both reflecting and influencing how packaging is produced, we propose a mathematical model for calculating a differential fee (the sustainable producer fee or SPF). The development of the model involves the following steps: the selection of sustainability criteria, the aggregation of criteria using multi-criteria decision making, the formulation of the SPF calculation, and the generation of a web-based interface for packers and product importers to calculate the differential fee applying to their own packaging. The aspects of sustainability considered are environmental aspects resulting mostly from life cycle assessment (e.g., global warming and human toxicity), and social aspects related to environmental information present in/on the packaging (e.g., the recycling bin symbol and carbon footprint information). The mathematical model developed uses the sustainability results provided by the multi-criteria decision making. The fee is higher than the current fixed fee (200.8 \u20ac/t) if the level of sustainability is low, that is, if environmental and social impacts are negative, and is lower if the level of sustainability is high.

Additionally, utilization of these waste biomasses reduces the environmental hazards associated with its disposal.

In this work, we have investigated the seasonal occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the surface water samples of Lake Manipal in southwest India. The concentration of MPs was found to be higher during the monsoon season (0.423 particles/L) in comparison with the post-monsoon (0.117 particles/L) period. The higher abundance is attributed to the input of storm-water sewers connected to the lake as well as surface runoff during periods of high rainfall. The concentrations of small-sized (0.3\u20131 mm) microplastics were greater in both seasons. Approximately 96% of the microplastics were fibres, followed by smaller amounts of fragments, pellets, films, and foams. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the principal polymer composition of the microplastics, followed by cellulose. The PET and cellulose fibres were mainly derived from the laundering of clothes in the residential colonies and hostels situated close to the lake. The storm-water sewers were the likely conduit for these PET fibres into the lake. The Pollution Load Index (PLI) data reveals that pollution due to microplastics in Lake Manipal falls within the Level I risk category. The PLI was higher during the monsoon season due to an increased flux of these particles from the nearby region. During the post-monsoon period, the PLI values decreased, suggesting that MPs in the water column may have settled and mixed with the sediments.

FGOs eliminated the adverse impacts of PS pollution on growth, water status, gas exchange and oxidative stress markers. In addition, FGOs preserve the biochemical reactions of photosynthesis by actively increasing chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in the stressed-wheat leaves.

The vacuum in porous materials, even at relatively low vacuum levels, has a significant effect on sound reduction.

From the literature, the oxygen permeability coefficient improved with the high strength, modulus, and ductility, as the nanocellulose was reinforcing with biopolymer. This might be due to nanocellulose that contributes to the higher stretchability of the composite biofilms. A fine dispersion of nanocellulose throughout the polymer host promoted several improved properties of the composite biofilms.

In recent years there has been an increase in both consumer and legislative pressure on the packaging sector to reduce the environmental impact of its products, which are often only single use items. Using data from a plastics manufacturer, a cradle-to-grave study was conducted for trays produced from recycled polyethylene terephthalate, calculating their product carbon footprint and analysing how various parameters affect the carbon footprint. A model based on a spreadsheet analysis was developed, which allows the product carbon footprint to be determined using production batch data. It was found that the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of 1 kg of recycled polyethylene terephthalate trays containing 85% recycled content was 1.538 kg CO2e. The raw material, manufacturing, secondary packaging, transport and end-of-life stages each contributed 45%, 38%, 5%, 3% and 9% of the total life cycle greenhouse gases respectively. The recycled content of raw material was found to have a significant effect on product carbon footprint: a 24% decrease in tray carbon footprint could be obtained by manufacturing trays from 100% recycled content, compared to the current recycled content level of 85%. A reduction in tray weight was found to give almost an equivalent proportionate reduction in carbon footprint, with 20% and 30% tray weight reductions resulting in product carbon footprint reductions of 18.7% and 28% respectively. Transport was found to only contribute a minor amount of the greenhouse gases (3%) and hence improving transport efficiency had very little effect on the carbon footprint. The effect of end-of-life treatment was also found to be relatively small. The worst case scenario of no recycling taking place in the end-of-life stage results in the carbon footprint of the trays increasing by 2.7%, while increasing the recycling rate from 23.7% to 32% and 50%, results in the carbon footprint decreasing by 1% and 3% respectively. In both the extrusion and thermoforming processes, the specific manufacturing carbon footprints arising from consumption of electricity, chilled water energy and compressed air were found to decrease logarithmically with production speed. The greatest reductions in the carbon footprint of recycled polyethylene terephthalate trays can be achieved in the raw material and manufacturing life cycle stages. The proportion of recycled raw material should be maximised while extrusion and thermoforming process speeds should be optimised as significant manufacturing energy reductions can be attained when the speeds of both processes are increased.

The procedure is based on the Ecological Footprint indicator and the project's bill of quantities, where the latter traditionally classifies project elements into three major categories: materials, manpower, and machinery. Each element has an associated footprint in terms of fossil fuel, cropland, pastures, forest and carbon absorption land, productive sea, and/or built land. The Chilean dwelling has an Ecological Footprint per m2 of floor area similar to that in Spain. The first is mainly built out of wooden materials, while the second is made of concrete and brick. The forest footprint of wooden materials is high compared to the fossil footprint of ceramic materials. The construction cost is significantly lower in Chile than in Spain, due to the cost of construction materials. In the case of the Chilean project, the footprint can be reduced from 0.17 to 0.07\u202fhag/m2, largely due to the use of recycled wood. In Spain, a 25% reduction is achieved by using recycled concrete and steel, and by substituting ceramic vaults with cement vaults. The indicator is sensitive to different building typologies and construction materials, such as wooden, ceramic, and concrete products. The main obstacles in the assessment are related to the classification system of construction work.", "qas": [{"id": "14466", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "productive sea", "answer_start": 824}, {"text": "concrete", "answer_start": 1034}, {"text": "recycled concrete", "answer_start": 1449}, {"text": "wooden, ceramic, concrete products", "answer_start": 1768}]}]}, {"context": "Microplastics (MPs) are emerging global contaminants, attracting more and more attention because of their difficulty in degradation, extensive and persistent pollution.

The first test (under accelerated landfill conditions) was done at 21 \u00b0C, and three moisture levels, extending to 390 days and the second test (a high solids anaerobic digestion test under optimal and significantly accelerated conditions) was conducted at 35 \u00b0C for 170 days.

We conclude that semicrystalline PLA (typical of >96 wt% of resin used to manufacture products), under anaerobic biological conditions typical of a landfill at moderate temperatures (where PLA hydrolysis is slow), will not lead to significant generation of methane, and that no significant population of organisms is available under anaerobic conditions to directly degrade high molecular weight PLA. Because there was no direct biological degradation of PLA under the anaerobic conditions, it is likely that any degradation of PLA in a landfill would require a chemical hydrolysis step prior to any biodegradation, which is analogous to the situation in aerobic composting. At 20 \u00b0C this process is estimated to take 100+ years, and under those conditions the degradation of the PLA would be extremely low.

The main reason is that precious metals, rare earth elements and plastics can be recovered with the highest yield and purity in a disassembly based treatment. However, original equipment manufacturers currently face several issues for the implementation of design for disassembly. To overcome these issues, first of all an in-depth analysis of design-for-disassembly opportunities and challenges is presented. Taking into account the results of this analysis, innovative low-cost elastomer-based fasteners have been developed, which can be simultaneously released by applying a sufficiently high force over a period of time. In addition, an experimental validation method was developed and adopted to demonstrate that the developed fasteners allow reducing the disassembly time by 70%\u201390% for the housing of LCD TVs without compromising product robustness. The presented calculations indicate that the implementation of the developed fasteners is profitable from an overall perspective in regions with a labor cost higher than 7 \u20ac/h. However, original equipment manufacturers currently lack incentives to adopt design for disassembly for products sold in a Business-to-Consumer market, which are jointly collected and treated at end-of-life. Therefore, a differentiation in recycling fees proportional to the reduction in disassembly time is proposed to provide economic stimuli for original equipment manufacturers to implement these fasteners.

Concerning oil and gas production, PS provides a small synergy. However, PVC showed a significant positive synergy on oil yield with a maximum value of 11\u202fwt% at 50\u202fwt% PVC content, which was linked to a strong negative synergy in gas production.

Furthermore, by comparing the distribution of chloride species in the products of co-pyrolysis with PVC, using experimental and theoretical methods, we discovered that the negative synergy in HCl yield observed was mainly due to the dissolution of HCl in the water fraction of the condensed oil phase, rather than the formation of chlorinated organic compounds, as suggested in previous literature works.

Detailed analyses are performed in order to determine the extent to which the energy consumed by and the CO2 emissions released from this system could be reduced. This is done by estimating the possible effects of (a) using waste as a resource, and (b) using biomass as a feedstock.

The aim of this work was to develop a method to regionalize emissions of macroplastic and microplastic for soil, freshwater and air using geographical datasets on land-use statistics, traffic and population densities, wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflows as proxies. High resolution maps of the emissions were then generated for micro- and macroplastic using emission data available for Switzerland for seven commonly used polymers (low-density-polyethylene, high-density-polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, polyvinyl-chloride and polyethylene-terephthalate). Most of the emissions can be found in areas with high human activity, but the influence of the different proxies varies for each polymer. The median emission rate of macroplastic on soil varies from 0.0006 to 0.06\u202fkg/ha/year, whereas no emission flows are predicted for more than 50% of the raster cells for microplastic regardless of the polymer, but the maxima can reach up to 12.7\u202fkg/ha/a in the case of HDPE. The average emission rate of macroplastic along river segments ranges between 0.062\u202fkg/km/a and 1.5\u202fkg/km/a. For microplastic, the average emission rate varies from 0.0025\u202fkg/km/a to 0.11\u202fkg/km/a. The analysis reveals that a significant deviation is expected if the population density is used as only proxy.

To develop strategy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of animal-based food supply chains, the common environmental hotspots among different types of food, the role of transport logistics and the consequence of end market need to be better understood. Life cycle assessment was adopted to model three types of animal-based food chains (beef, butter and salmon), with specific technologies, high spatial-resolution logistics and typical consumption patterns for three markets: local, regional (intra-European) and international. The results confirmed that the farm production stage usually had the greatest environmental impact, except when air transport was used for distribution. Potentially, the role of end market also can significantly influence the environmental impacts. To understand more, three improvement options were examined in detail with regard to hotspots for climate change: novel feed ingredients (farm production stage), sustainable aviation fuel (transport and logistics stage) and reduction of wasted food (consumption and end of life stage). Significant reduction was achieved in the salmon system by sustainable aviation fuel (64%) and novel feed (15%). Minimizing food waste drove the greatest reduction in the beef supply chain (23%) and the international butter supply chain can reduce 50% of GHG mission by adopting sustainable aviation fuel. Combined interventions could reduce GHG emission of animal-based food supply chains by 15% to 82%, depending on market, transport and food waste behaviour.

Fe3O4@DAL combined with the advantages of lignin and magnetic nanoparticles, which had abundant functional groups (phenols and aliphatic hydroxyl, carboxyl, phenyl) and high separation efficiency, so typical FQs including pefloxacin (PEF), lomefloxacin (LOM), enrofloxacin (ENR) and difluoxacin (DIF) could be easily removed by multiple interactions. The Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model could be more suitable to describe the adsorption process of FQs on Fe3O4@DAL.

In particular, the recycled adsorbent can be degraded as slow-release fertilizer under the action of soil microorganisms, which helps the growth of plants and further expands application range of lignin.

Current literature identifies numerous opportunities for resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction. However, this literature is scattered across several sources and units of analysis. Using a Systematic Literature Review, this paper identifies eight recurrent product and process-related themes and fifteen specific subthemes of resource efficiency in industrialized housing construction across building lifecycle phases. These themes can be based on product such as the use of innovative and industrial materials or on process such as the use of inventory monitoring and tracking. Additional industry and regulatory themes are also identified.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for microstructural analysis is performed to elucidate the mechanism of strength development. The results obtained showed that reduce the specific weight of the LMEPVC composites and improve their thermal insulation, particularly the composite LMEPVC75 (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f0.760\u202fW/m.K).

This can be credited to their outstanding physicochemical characteristics and superlative mechanical features, including inherent hydrophobicity, enhanced oleophilicity, precise and physically linked permeable networks, enormous surface area, and profound porosity, amongst others. Herein, we provide a systematic overview of the contemporary progress towards the fabrication of innovative 3D GMAs for eliminating oils and organic solvents from water surfaces, predominantly from the viewpoint of molecular design and engineering. Further, we highlight the various surface modification strategies that can be exploited to extend the absorption capacity of bulk hydrocarbons by 3D GMAs. Additionally, underlying challenges are identified and original future research plans are proposed, toward strategizing further advances in this promising environmental restoration approach.", "qas": [{"id": "14782", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "recurrent oil/chemical spillage events", "answer_start": 172}, {"text": "oils", "answer_start": 1131}]}]}, {"context": "The European Union (EU-27) targets buildings' decarbonization by 2050, and prefabrication presents an opportunity to reduce buildings and construction sector impacts.

The present study aimed to examine the effect of precursor and lightweight aggregate type on workability, compressive strength, flexural strength as well as the environmental impact of lightweight mortars. For this purpose, precursors derived from waste aluminosilicate sources including ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), metakaolin (MK), waste ceramic powder (WCP), and waste clay brick powder (WCBP) were used for the synthesis of alkali-activated and geopolymer mortars. In addition, an equivalent Portland cement mortar was prepared for comparison purposes. Pumice and lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) were used as the lightweight aggregates. Based on the test results, the WCP- and WCBP-based geopolymer mortars exhibited a higher workability than other mortar mixes. Generally, mortars prepared with pumice aggregate showed lower workability and higher mechanical strength than LECA incorporated mixes due to the higher density of pumice and its better bonding with paste. Alkali-activated and geopolymer mortars presented a higher initial strength and reached about 80% of their 28-day compressive strength in 1 day, whereas that of the cement mortar was only 33%. The maximum 28-day compressive strength (82.5 MPa) and flexural strength (9.28 MPa) were obtained for the GGBFS-based and MK-based mortars, respectively, which were about 29% and 41% higher than that of the counterpart Portland cement mortar. From an ecological point of view, geopolymer and alkali-activated mortars exhibited about 50% (on average) less carbon footprint and were 25% (on average) lower in energy demands.

The materials disposed were mainly made up of wood and concrete, similar to other C&D debris sites, but the amount of gypsum drywall (below 3% of the waste) was significantly smaller than other available studies, where percentages above 20% had been reported. Leachate contained typical C&D pollutants, such as different inorganic ions and metals, some of which exceeded other values reported in the literature (conductivity, ammonium, lead and arsenic). The small net precipitation in the area and the leachate recirculation into the landfill surface help explain these higher concentrations, thus highlighting the impact of liquid to solid (L/S) ratio on leachate characteristics.

This characteristic is an advantage over conventional infrared (IR) spectrometers. A 75 cm2 scan area was probed in less than 1 min at a pixel size of 156 \u00d7 156 \u03bcm. An in-house comprehensive spectral dataset, including weathered microplastics, was used to build multivariate supervised soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) classification models.

The study centres on a growing bibliography over this period, emphasizing some fundamental parameters of hemp raw materials and related building materials, the binders used in the production of hemp aggregate concretes and assessments of different aspects of their performance. The most important properties of hemp concrete vary according to the quality of the plant aggregates, the choice of binders (typically aerial or hydraulic lime), the proportions of the raw materials and the application techniques. Organic aggregates are less stable than inorganic aggregates and are therefore more difficult to use in a concrete mix with both inorganic and organic binders. Among other reasons, this is due to the disproportionate amount of water required in the mixing of plant-based concretes and to the release of organic compounds, which can have serious effects on the hardening process. This problem was identified in scientific studies on the use of hemp concrete in sustainable, bioclimatic construction, whether applied as a semi-liquid mass or as a precast element. This new biomaterial offers excellent results in terms of its application on site and has important physical properties, such as high durability and easy conservation.

Strict quality control up to the detailed process flow sheet by FDA, and the commonly low production rate are the main reasons for batch operations, among others. The primary form of continuous culture is a steady state continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) or chemostat. A chemostat ensures a time-invariant chemical environment for the cell cultivation. The growth rate can be directly manipulated and substrate concentration in the reactor is low, which can promote a desired product formation. The productivity of chemostat increases with increasing dilution rate to a maximum before sharply decreasing near the washout limit, which is affected by the endogenous needs and/or death rate. The growth and/or product formation patterns can be different between batch and continuous cultivations; for example, a lag-phase in batch and metabolic overflow (or Crabtree) effect in a continuous system. The use of cell recycle with a CSTR increases volumetric productivity and has found use in large-volume, consistent production demand and low-product-value processes (eg, waste treatment and fuel-grade ethanol production), as well as increased use in high-product-value processes (eg, pharmaceutical applications using perfusion systems with mammalian cells). Both analytical and graphical methods of solutions have been demonstrated in examples.

The waste fractions suitable for RDF have a high calorific value and are often not suitable for material recycling. With current treatment processes, RDF still contains components which impede the utilization in firing systems or limit the degree of substitution.

This article describes a new technology for the separation of impurities from refuse derived fuels based on a rotating fluidized bed. In this concept a rotating motion of the particle bed is obtained by the tangential injection of the fluidization gas in a static geometry. The RDF-particles experience a centrifugal force which fluidized the bed radially. The technical principle allows tearing up of particle clusters to single particles. Radially inwards the vertical velocity is much lower thus particles of every description can fall down there.

As a consequence, reduction of CO2 emissions is considered to be difficult and costly. However little attention has been paid as of yet to changes related to so-called non-energy use of fossil fuels. The analysis in this paper suggests that a large number of options exist for emission reduction in the Japanese petrochemical industry. This includes the introduction of biomass feedstocks, the introduction of new catalytic production processes, and changes in waste handling. The use of bioplastics and the use of CO2 feedstocks seem costly options for GHG emission reduction that should not be applied on the short term. Japanese GHG emissions can be reduced by 7.7% if the optimal set of emission mitigation options is applied. About 60 Mt emission reduction (4.9%) can be achieved by changes on the supply side, another 35 Mt emission reduction (2.8%) can be achieved by changes in waste management. While changes in waste management can be implemented before 2010, biomass introduction on the supply side will probably require a longer lead-time.

Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA).

The environmental performance of the insulation is determined using the Life Cycle Assessment-LCA-technique. A new scoring tool is created which allows inputted data, across the three areas of performance (energy, environmental, economic), to be standardized and compared, providing a final score that represents the overall performance. The input data and weightings can be modified easily to investigate new materials and to meet user requirements. Out of all the insulations, cellulose fibre showed the best overall performance. The model results highlight the importance of the hygrothermal properties of the insulation, and their compatibility with the substrate, for best energy performance. The insulated earth buildings require less energy for heating and are responsible for lower carbon emissions than the insulated brick buildings. This is attributed to the lower diffusivity of the earth walls attenuating external temperature fluctuation and economizing energy. The permeable insulations (cork and hemp) tend to perform better with earth than with brick, which is attributed to a more compatible hydric performance. The model results indicate that the best thermal performance is obtained when insulation is placed outside the wall.", "qas": [{"id": "15072", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "heating energy requirement", "answer_start": 186}, {"text": "energy", "answer_start": 194}, {"text": "cellulose fibre", "answer_start": 945}, {"text": "best energy performance", "answer_start": 1139}]}]}, {"context": "Bio-plastics have gained tremendous attention, due to the increasing environmental pressure on global warming and plastic pollution. Among them, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is both bio-based and bio-degradable, which has been widely used in many disposable packaging applications. The global market for PLA demand doubles every 3\u20134 years, as estimated by Jem's law. Compared to traditional petroleum-based plastics, PLA is more expensive and usually has less mechanical and physical properties. The recent compounding efforts and the commercialization of D(\u2212) lactic acid and its polymer PDLA have the potential to improve the mechanical and thermal characteristics of PLA (e.g. by forming stereocomplex PLA) for applications in high-end markets. However, the usage of PLA in some other applications is still limited. With a structure similar to PLA, poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) has promising characteristics such as good biodegradability and barrier properties, which is potentially a beneficial supplement to PLA. The modification of PLA with PGA can be achieved via co-polymerization, physical blending and multilayer lamination. PGA and its combination with PLA have been widely studied in bio-medical applications, but not been well developed at large scales due to its relatively high production cost. In this case, the development of novel production technology and the advent of government regulations are the key drivers for the global transition towards bioplastics. Recently, multiple governmental regulations have been released that restrict the use of traditional plastics and facilitate bio-degradable plastic applications. PGA can be derived from industrial waste gases using an innovative production technology, which reduces carbon emissions and its production cost. By developing the production and compounding technology, PGA can be combined with PLA to play an essential role for a sustainable and environmental friendly plastic industry, especially for single-used products requiring fast degradation at room temperature or in the nature environment.", "qas": [{"id": "15073", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "relatively high production cost", "answer_start": 1271}, {"text": "novel production technology", "answer_start": 1337}, {"text": "innovative production technology", "answer_start": 1690}, {"text": "production cost", "answer_start": 1287}, {"text": "production compounding technology", "answer_start": 2067}, {"text": "single-used products", "answer_start": 1970}]}]}, {"context": "               The importance of bio-based polymers and their derived materials lies in the fact of the great variety of renewable feedstock and the environmentally friendly perspectives of materials.

To which massive use of plastic film as mulch is among the leading contributors. Lack of viable alternatives for conventional polyethylene (PE) film which is the predominant type currently used as mulch; has made the scenario even worst. Biodegradable mulch (BDM) films have the potential to ameliorate the problem of residue accumulation of PE plastic film in soil. But non-affordable price and lower reliability of consumers coupled with lack of aesthetic value in the field are some of the main hindrances, hampering wider acceptability of BDMs. Moreover, still little is known about the key mechanisms involved in biodegradation, active plastic degrading organisms, and actual fate of resultant micro-particles in the soil. Identifying efficient microorganisms that could immediately biodegrade plastic film mulch (PFM) after use can be paramount in developing BDM films and bioremediation of pollution problem. Recycling of the synthetic PE films also can play a vital role and offers solution to ameliorate several related hazards, but heavy investment is needed to obtain the desired results.

As increasingly stringent legislation forces Shredder Residues (SR) to be diverted from landfilling, newly developed technologies will be in a position to compete for the market value of disposing of the waste. However, the fluff waste stream is so variable that it cannot be automatically assumed that processes developed for one type of fluff will prove to be suitable for other fluff streams.

Results show that the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced the marine pollution research by: (i) increasing the number of publications; (ii) reshaping different countries' roles in marine pollution research; (iii) altering the hotspots of marine pollution research. The ranking of countries with high productivity in the marine pollution research field changed, and developed economies are the dominant players both before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in this field. Other high-productivity countries, with the exception of China, have higher international cooperation rates in marine pollution research than those before the pandemic. Microplastic pollution has been the biggest challenge of marine pollution and has been aexplored in greater depth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the mining results of marine pollution publications show the mitigation of plastic pollution in the marine environment remains the main content requires future research. Finally, this paper puts forward corresponding suggestions for the reference of researchers and practitioners to improve the global ability to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic to the marine environment.", "qas": [{"id": "15154", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "high productivity", "answer_start": 678}, {"text": "Other high-productivity countries", "answer_start": 868}]}]}, {"context": "The present work explored the design and testing, at pilot scale, of a new food packaging prototype, based on biodegradable polymers and eco-materials obtained from agri-food residues using an environmentally friendly process for its application in vegetable products.

This paper reviews the literature concerning the microplastic pollution in the Yangtze River basin and analyzes the abundance, shapes, colors, and composition of microplastics in the water bodies and sediments in the trunk stream and main lakes of the Yangtze River. The results are as follows. Compared to other river basins in China and abroad, the microplastics in the Yangtze River basin have a moderate abundance and high spatial heterogeneity. Owing to the barrier effect of the Three Gorges Dam on microplastics, the abundance of microplastics in the Three Gorges Reservoir is generally an order of magnitude higher than that in other sections of the river. Most microplastics in the water bodies and sediments are less than 1 mm in size and are transparent and colorful. In terms of shapes, they are dominated by fibers, followed by fragments and films. In terms of composition, the microplastics in the source region of the Yangtze River are mainly composed of nylon and polyethylene, while the microplastics in the surface water from the lower reaches of the Jinsha River to the Yangtze River estuary are dominated by polypropylene and polyethylene.

In this review, the properties of functionalized wood materials are compared with those of other conventional and emerging synthetic materials, and their potential in various applications as advanced materials is analyzed.

It could cost billions to maintain and improve the treatment framework, using conventional wastewater treatment plants to meet the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Eutrophication and hypoxia resulting from phosphorus runoff from commercial and industrial wastewater plants can lead to unwanted algae growth. \"Dead zones\" are created after algae decay, causing the death of the aquatic life that needs an oxygen-rich environment. The upper limit for in-stream discharge of phosphorus is usually one mg L\u2212                  1, and further lowering to < 0.1 mg L\u2212                  1 is required to meet or exceed the current USEPA requirement. As far as we know, there is no product to extract phosphate from abundant water sources to reduce phosphate to ultralow levels that will meet the latest, most stringent USEPA requirements economically. In timber processing landfills and wood disposal sites, groundwater contamination by wood waste disposal also creates runoffs containing radioactive metals, which further degrade the water quality in freshwater bodies. The application of nanomaterials from renewable resources can help reduce phosphate from wastewater.

Plant polyphenols, as ubiquitous biomass, reveal low cost, nontoxicity, strong metal chelate ability and good adhesive property towards various substrates. Plant polyphenols and their coordination polymers have recently been regarded as a powerful tool for engineering functional nanomaterials. Herein, the recent progress of plant polyphenol-based coordination polymers and their derived functional mesoporous materials have been comprehensively reviewed. Firstly, based on the strong interactions between polyphenols and various assembly units (e.g., metal ions, soft-template) or substrates (e.g., polystyrene sphere), metal-polyphenol coordination polymers (MPCPs) with capsule structure, crystalline framework, colloidal spheres or mesoporous network can be prepared. Secondly, polyphenols are regarded as an excellent sustainable carbon source. When metal-polyphenol coordination polymers are used as a carbon precursor, mesoporous carbon materials including pure carbon, heteroatom doping, or metal nanoparticle loading are prepared. Thirdly, due to the tunable compositions of MPCPs, mesoporous metal oxide spheres with tunable metal species, solid or hollow structure, complex compositions (e.g., multi-metals or high-entropy metal oxides) are prepared. Fourthly, the applications of MPCPs derived mesoporous materials, including energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and biomedicine, have been summarized. Compared with the most commonly used metal\u2013organic frameworks, MPCPs are constructed from renewable plant polyphenols. Most importantly, polyphenols are one kind molecular glue and can interact with various molecules. Various components can be incorporated into the MPCPs. MPCPs can also be deposited on various substrates. After thermal decomposition, functional nanoporous composites and films are obtained.

For this reason, the present study investigates the embodied energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a residential multi-storey timber building with an increase in height by performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) with an integrated approach that considers structural behaviour and includes connectors and fasteners. The results presented as relative and absolute contributions of different building elements show that the embodied impacts per floor decrease as the building height increases, However, relative and absolute contributions of different building elements change with the variation in the number of storeys. While the building envelope is recognised as a critical element when considering GHG emissions, the load-bearing timber structure is a critical element when considering cumulative energy demand (CED). The results further revealed the importance of connectors and fasteners, as they account for up to 4.80% of the non-renewable CED at the building level, and up to 25.66% when assessing the load-bearing timber structure.

Similarly, the thermal diffusivity decreased with the increasing DPP content and became 0.034 mm 2 / s . However, this increased the water absorption (~5.6% at 40 wt . % in cold water). The compressive strength decreased with the addition of DPP, which was attributed to the filler agglomeration and low compatibility between PLA and DPP. The compressive strength of the PLA\u2013DPP composite was higher than those of the commonly used insulating materials and comparable to those of the construction materials (84.3\u201364.4 MPa).

Phase transfer kinetic and equilibrium effects limit the biodegradation of hydrophobic VOCs especially at high concentrations. This study evaluates two strategies for overcoming the problem. First, a natural process was used to enhance the aqueous availability of styrene, a hydrophobic VOC model, by inoculating the BTF with a mixture of biosurfactant\u2013generating bacteria. This method achieved a maximum elimination capacity (ECmax) of 139 g m-3h\u22121 in the BTF at an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 60s. The highest concentrations of the biosurfactants surfactin and rhamnolipid were 205 and 86 mg L-1, respectively, in this step.

Second, the effect of adding H2O2 to the recycle liquid on the BTF performance was determined. The biodegradation and mineralization of styrene in the BTF operated at a loading rate of 266 g m-3h\u22121 and H2O2/styrene molar ratio of 0.05 with EBRT as short as 15 s were 94% and 53%, respectively, with the EC of 250 g m-3h\u22121. High concentrations of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase and catalase: 56 and 7 U gbiomass -1, respectively) were produced and biosurfactant generation was increased in this step, contributing to enhanced styrene biodegradation and mineralization. The styrene biodegradation and mineralization values in the BTF in the last day operated under similar conditions but without H2O2 were 11.4% and 5.3%, respectively.

One of the measures for achieving this goal is the promotion of low-carbon urban development, which includes urban greening. Oysters are produced in all districts of Japan but Hiroshima Prefecture is particularly famous for its high production levels. The production of oysters generates oyster shells as a by-product, which are used commercially as livestock feed and a soil conditioner. However, the reuse of oyster shells remains limited. Pervious concrete is a special type of concrete in which single-sized aggregates are bound together with cement paste or mortar and is considered an environmentally friendly material because of its high water permeability. Therefore, we investigated whether oyster shell pervious concrete (OyPC) containing crushed oyster shell aggregate would be suitable for growing plants for potential application as a planting foundation for urban greening. Zoysia tenuifolia sod or Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) seeds were directly placed or sown in soil on the surfaces of OyPC and crushed stone pervious concrete specimens, which were then placed in plastic containers for either 72 days (short-term planting tests) or 802 days (long-term planting test). OyPC had a higher plant-growing performance than crushed stone pervious concrete in both the short- and long-term planting tests and also pumped the water from the container to moisten the sod and the soil covering the seeds, assisting the growth of plants. The grass on OyPC that has a small particle size could grow without water retention material which is indispensable to crushed stone pervious concrete for greening.

Because the backfill above the cut-and-cover tunnel (CCT) requires a large quantity of material, an appropriate ratio of scrap tire rubber particles and sand should be selected as the LFM mixture.

Over time, humans established a sedentary lifestyle (about 3000 to 12,000years ago) with increasing agricultural expertise, and as populations grew, certain groups formed complex civilizations and lost their egalitarian features due to the rise of despotic dominants. Within the past few thousand years, many individuals and their societies have transformed from an egalitarian status to become more independent, evolving from a quasi-eusocial existence to a more-or-less asocial (solitary or private) one, even though we live and work closer together in larger populations.               Many humans have progressively become so preoccupied with modern life, their jobs, the political establishment, and individual desires that they have lost their connection with Mother Nature, the biological system that bore them. Except for a small but very valuable, sometimes heroic few, many contemporary humans could not care less about other species that they coinhabit Earth with or the ecosystems that support them. Many humans are even losing touch with each other.               Within recent years, humans have raced almost unconsciously toward their biotic potential as an ultramodern, overpopulated cosmopolitan species. The question we must now ask ourselves is this: with all of the evolutionary changes the human species and its predecessors have undergone, have they managed to develop features that keep them from being overbearingly threatening to other species, themselves, and the world, or have they remained more animalistic and increased their high degree of arrogant dominance, aggression, and technological capabilities to the point of putting everything they know in harm's way?

Without predators to keep our numbers down and in spite of our wars, disease epidemics, flare-ups of genocide, and secret societies that have been adamant about eliminating what they feel represents the weaker segment of the human species, our cosmopolitan population has grown all too rapidly.               The large-scale beginning of the oil industry has been attributed to the drilling of a well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The first offshore oil well was drilled near Summerland, California, in 1887. It was only 300ft from the water's edge and connected to the land by a long wharf. The first well in marine waters that was not connected to the land was drilled at Caddo Lake, Louisiana, in 1911.               During the 1920s and 1930s, wells were drilled in the lakes, swamps, and bayous of southern Louisiana. The Model T was introduced in 1908, and by 1916, half of the cars in the United States were Model Ts (Berger, 2001; Williams et\u00a0al., 1992). By 2012, there were 240.5million cars and light trucks being driven in the United States alone, the largest vehicle population in the world. In 2010, the global number of cars exceeded 1.015billion.               Buying and selling petroleum products around the world has been big business, and getting petroleum from one country to another requires movement over water. That oil was being harvested for some time under marine waters and transported to other locations has been a disaster in the making. By the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, there had been oil spills all over the world, caused either by naval accidents or during major wars.               Oil spills are dangerous for all forms of life. Since at least half of the oxygen in the world is generated in the oceans, this is of particular importance to marine photoautotrophs and organisms that depend on them for an aerobic environment. Further, upon reaching the edges of a marine environment, precious mangrove environments and intertidal zones, areas that are extremely biodiverse, are affected, and this, in turn, affects terrestrial organisms. In addition to the ecological significance of mangrove and intertidal destruction, the die-off of sea creatures halts marine-related businesses and affects the livelihood of numerous people who depend on coastlines.               As disastrous as these oil spills have been to planetary abuse, we may wonder whether they were the beginning of coastline destruction? The Gulf of Mexico, like many other areas in the world that lie close to human populations, was a deteriorating ecological disaster area long before the release of oil, and the roots of these disasters, also from the hands of humans, are on land.               The Mississippi River is a mighty river that receives drainage water from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems throughout its course. Small and large streams and rivers throughout the Midwest drain extensive areas and flow into the Mississippi. Pesticides and fertilizers used by humans enter runoff which flows into the river, and they, along with vast amounts of other pollutants, are dumped into the Gulf of Mexico. These chemicals, which have killed unknown numbers of terrestrial and aquatic organisms en route to the Gulf, have subsequently created a dead zone in Gulf waters off the coast of Louisiana.               Some of the chemicals found in runoff promote the growth and reproduction of many marine microorganisms. Nitrogen-rich compounds found in fertilizer and waste material runoff provide nutrients that result in algal blooms. Upon the termination of a bloom, there is a great dying of organisms that sink to the bottom of the water and decompose, depleting the water of oxygen. It occurs in other waters around the world as well.               The Northern Gulf of Mexico's hypoxic waters represent one of the Western Hemisphere's largest \u201cdead zones\u201d\u2014areas where a lack of oxygen kills fish, crustaceans, and other marine life. The size of the Gulf zone varies but at its peak, it stretches along the inner continental shelf from the mouth of the Mississippi River westward to the upper Texas coast, covering about 7000square miles, an area as large as New Jersey. Long-term consequences to biodiversity, species abundance, and biomass in the Gulf are not yet known, but experience with other coastal dead zones has shown significant ecological deterioration and depleted fisheries.               One hundred and forty-six dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels were reported in 2003. Some of these were small, but the largest dead zone covered 70,000km2 (27,000 mi). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide, and in January 2011, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) identified 534 low-oxygen \u201cdead zones\u201d and an additional 228 sites worldwide exhibiting signs of marine eutrophication (areas with an overabundance of certain chemicals, e.g., fertilizers and pesticides). WRI has since discovered 13 additional sites that are already eutrophic and in danger of becoming dead zones, bringing the total number of coastal areas around the world known to be suffering from nutrient pollution at the time of this writing to 775.

The products analyzed were butter with 80% fat in 250-g wrap, 250-g tub, and 10-g mini tub, and blends with 80% and 60% fat in 250-g tubs. Life cycle assessment was used to account for all greenhouse gas emissions from cow to consumer. A critical aspect when calculating the CF is how emissions are allocated between different products. Here, allocation of raw milk between products was based on a weighted fat and protein content (1:1.7), based on the price paid for raw milk to dairy farmers. The CF (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) for 1kg of butter or blend (assuming no product waste at consumer) ranged from 5.2kg (blend with 60% fat content) to 9.3kg of CO2e (butter in 250-g tub). When including product waste at the consumer level, the CF ranged from 5.5kg of CO2e (blend with 60% fat content) to 14.7kg of CO2e (butter in mini tub). Fat content and the proportion of vegetable oil in products had the greatest effect on CF of the products, with lower fat content and a higher proportion of vegetable oil resulting in lower CF. Hence, if the same functionality as butter could be retained while shifting to lower fat and higher proportions of vegetable oil, the CF of the product would be decreased. Size and type of packaging were less important, but it is crucial to have the correct size and type of packaging to avoid product losses at the consumer.

This review paper provides detailed information about thermal and fire resistance characteristics of polymer composites with the literature supporting system from the fabrication methods, filler thermal behavior of polymer matrix composites, and fire resistance abilities of the filler-based polymer composites. In literature, studies proposed that fillers are one of the excellent materials to prevent polymeric materials from fire hazards. They have excellent behavior to control the fire and act as a very good fire-retardant material in time of fire explosion. This unique property of the fillers leads the polymer products towards fire stopping applications.

From the acetone extracted quantities and the plasticizer absorption measurements it appears that only 1\u20132% di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DOP) was lost during the service-life of cables and most of the initial quantity remained in the cable composition so only a small addition is necessary for the reprocessing. The IR spectra of polymer extracted from electrical cable waste exhibit important changes concerning double bonds and carbonyl groups. The T g value is higher for the waste material indicating that it was rigidized due to the polyene fragments arising from partial dehydrochlorination. This is also supported by the viscometric and GPC measurements, the PVC from waste having a higher molecular weight than virgin PVC. Based on T g curves and static thermal stability the following order of thermal stability has been established: PVC waste jacket<PVC electrical cable waste<virgin PVC<PVC virgin cable formulation.

However, the environmental and health effects of MPs when they enter the environment are not fully known, and the consequent damage based on their occurrence, behavior, and fate is yet to be explored.

The recovery of residual biomass as integrated renewable energy source could represent an interesting option for the substitution of fossil energy, contributing to the transition of agro-food sector towards a low-carbon economy. Two scenarios were compared, in order to evaluate the impacts of a fossil fuel-based food chain and the potential benefits of the integration of bioenergy production, using peach nectar as case study. In the first scenario, peach nectar is produced, distributed and consumed using fossil energy, while residuals are wasted. In the second scenario, byproducts from the nectar chain are used to produce bioenergy from combustion or anaerobic digestion, which is then consumed to substitute electricity and heat. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) based on the same functional unit was performed. Main results show that, in the conventional scenario, most of the damage derives from land use, especially for sugar and glucose production, from the fossil energy consumption of about 15 MJ l\u22121, and the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.91 kg CO2 eq l\u22121.

A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined.

On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking. The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem.

For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought. An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling.
