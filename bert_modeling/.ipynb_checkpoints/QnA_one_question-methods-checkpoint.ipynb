       "[{'context': 'A facile and green method is developed to synthesize cobalt species embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (P–Co@NCs). The materials are synthesized using hard template precursors via single-step in-situ thermal treatment under free solvent conditions. The optimal P–Co@NC composite prepared through rational synthesis and synergic composition shows an efficient electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reduction (OER). The P–Co@NC exhibits the OER overpotential of 350 mv at 10 mA cm−2 and low Tafel 73 mv·dec−1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The advantage of catalyst is the dispersion of Co species, which are in close interaction with nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The Co-Nx plays a dominating role among Co species in P–Co@NC and is well protected by the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix layer. That resulted in efficient electron transport on CNTs (high conductivity) that improves the OER performance of P–Co@NC compared to the reference catalysts (IrO2 and B–Co@NC). The P–Co@NC also showed excellent cycling performance from long-term chronoamperometry testing. Interestingly, the P–Co@NC catalyst could be synthesized straightforward via a short solvent-free single-step process that introduced it as a green and environmental friendly method, which can be potential to develop catalyst based on metal embedded N-doped carbon.',\n",

       " {'context': 'The catalytic upgrading of plastic pyrolysis oil was conducted in a 2-kg-scale pyrolysis oil separation system with or without zeolite 4A, Cu-based (MDC-7) and Ni-based catalysts to produce light (F1), middle (F2) and heavy (F3) oil fractions. From the preliminary separation tests without a catalyst, the separation vapor temperature for diesel-like middle fraction (C11 - C22) was determined to be in the range of 107–305 °C. After the pyrolysis oil separation with catalysts, the heavy carbon range (>C23) sharply decreased from 22.1 wt% in the crude plastic pyrolysis oil to 0.1–1.6 wt% and 7.3–8.4 wt% in the F1 and F2, respectively. Among three catalysts, Ni-based catalyst exhibited the highest deoxygenation capacity (1.23% O in F1 and 0.3% O in F2) owing to its strong acid sites concentration (1.115 mmol/g). Accordingly, the order of the deoxygenation capacity was Ni-based > MDC-7 > zeolite 4A > no catalyst. Moreover, the catalytic reactions (deoxygenation) and coke formation mainly occurred on the strong acid sites. MDC-7 catalyst contributed to more production of C6–C10 range (15.8 %) with aromatic and naphthenic compounds. In contrast, the major catalytic mechanisms of Ni-based catalyst were dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions. In addition, the physical properties of catalytically upgraded pyrolysis oil were close to those of the petroleum-based fuels. Finally, the current study suggested that Ni-based catalyst was a suitable catalyst for the production of diesel-like fraction (C11-C12) with the lowest contents of oxygen from the plastic pyrolysis oil.',\n",

The effect of the catalysts to the pyrolysis oil properties and the in-situ upgrading (especially the storage, transportation and corrosion stability) of pyrolysis oil was investigated. High concentration of Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/SAPO-11 zeolites in catalyst mixtures can increase the yield of gases and pyrolysis oil, the concentration of aromatics or the hydrogen content in gases; however the presence of red mud in higher content can further increase the hydrogen concentration. ZSM-5 based catalysts showed higher efficiency in aromatization reactions. An accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 1 week was performed to investigate the storage and transportation stability of pyrolysis oils. Only slight increase was found in the density and viscosity, on the other hand there was a bit greater increase using SAPO-11 based catalysts than ZSM-5. The change in the olefin content was followed via bromine number and FTIR spectra of pyrolysis oil, which resulted ∼3% and ∼4% decreasing using Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/SAPO-11 containing catalyst mixtures. Regarding acidic components, they significantly increased by aging time, while the high red mud and/or Ca(OH)2 in catalyst mixtures had notable benefit, because they can drastically decrease the concentration of chlorinated compounds, which led to less weight loss during corrosion test using copper plate till 60 days at 20 °C.',\n",

The catalytic degradation of LDPE waste was performed using the HZSM-5 catalyst at a low temperature of 400\\u202f°C to form non-condensable gases, which were subsequently used as a carbon source for the production of MWCNTs at 700\\u202f°C. The influence of Co/Mo ratio on the yield, morphological structure, thermal stability, purity, and quality of MWCNTs was studied. The freshly calcined catalysts were characterized using BET surface area, XRD, FTIR, and H2-TPR techniques. On the other hand, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and TGA analyses were performed for full characterization of the as-deposited carbon materials. The TPR and FTIR profiles of the fresh catalysts illustrated that the interaction between Co, Mo, and MgO increased by decreasing the Co/Mo ratio from 14.5 to 0.4. Also, the CoMo(6.5)/MgO catalyst displayed the highest surface properties compared to the other catalysts with different Co/Mo ratios. The CoMo(6.5)/MgO catalyst was the most active in terms of MWCNTs production. Moreover, the morphology, purity, and quality of the produced MWCNTs were strongly associated with the catalyst composition.

The primary objective of this study was to select suitable conditions to pyrolyse polymeric materials depending on the polymer type and properties of the desired final products, e.g., aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons and valuable chemical subproducts. Suitable conditions can be determined for the thermal conversion of polymeric materials, and using non-catalytic pyrolysis can yield chemical compounds such as alpha-methyl styrene from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and limonene from tire waste, which can be used in both fine chemicals and industrial production. The pyrolysis conditions can be modified in terms of the catalyst based on the tested waste polymer and result in products rich in BTEX fractions. Among all tested catalysts, the ZSM-5 catalyst based on aluminosilicate impregnated with nickel ions yielded the highest total fraction of aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons, especially from the pyrolysis of PP and PET. With this catalyst, more than 75 area% of the product stream (of the total identified product peaks by MS) consisted of aromatic and heteroaromatic fractions (e.g., terephthalonitrile from polyethylene terephthalate), which were composed of 5.6 and 19.9 area% benzene, 7.0 and 10.8 area% toluene, 5.7 and 10.6 area% ethylbenzene and 1.2 and 1.4 area% xylene for PP and PET, respectively.

The XRD and TPR results confirmed that the non-interacted metal oxides species were dominant in the structure of the catalysts with higher Fe2O3 or MoO3 contents, whereas several mixed oxide species were extensively present in the catalysts with moderate Fe2O3 and MoO3 contents. The obtained results revealed that the Fe/Mo ratio was found to play a crucial role on the catalytic growth activity as well as the type and morphology of as-deposited CNMs. All results showed that the type and morphology structure of carbon deposited can be adjusted by changing the Fe/Mo ratio in the MgO support.
