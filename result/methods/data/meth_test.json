[{"context": "A low technological corn cob particleboard has been under research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e.g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required for most of the above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e.g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e.g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes.

Further, Indian coals possess high ash content (20\u201340%) and hence they produce a low calorific value gas on gasification. Hence, the co-gasification of these coals with suitable fuels such as HDPE can raise the heating value of syngas. In this context, HDPE is co-gasified with a high ash Indian coal using CO2 as the gasification agent for syngas production. Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification behavior of HDPE with high ash coal (HAC) under CO2 atmosphere are analyzed by using a fixed bed reactor and a thermogravimetric analyzer.

Different compositions of PLA/CP and PLA/CP/ECO were prepared in form of platelets and investigated by thermal, morphological, structural and mechanical analyses. The poor interfacial adhesion between the hydrophobic PLA matrix and short, hydrophilic and randomly dispersed presscake fibers, well evidenced by morphological analysis, was responsible of PLA thermal degradation hastening, Tg decreasing and tensile properties dropping down, since no mechanical stress transfer occurred from the polymer to the dispersed phase. The inclusion of ECO slightly improved the above properties due to its mild compatibilizing action inducing a fairly tightening of the macromolecular structure. The recycling of CP waste fibers was effective in hastening the polymer biodegradation in common soil under environmental conditions. Indeed, biocomposites recovered after 90 days of soil burial tests evidenced morphological features typical of late stage PLA biodegradation, a drastic dropping down of molecular weights and a decreasing of PLA thermal stability.

Its production involves a pre-treatment strategy, which can remove either hemicellulose or lignin, followed by a cellulase cocktail-mediated hydrolysis of pre-treated biomass applying numerous modifications. The high production cost of sugar from biomass using high-solid loadings with the desired purity is the important limiting factor for their economic conversion into bio-renewables. Pre-treatment and cellulase-mediated enzymatic hydrolysis of recalcitrant biomass are among the major technical and economic impediments to the overall success of biorefineries. Critical parameters such as the high amount of cellulase required for biomass hydrolysis, high cellulase cost, unproductive binding of cellulase to lignin, inhibitive reactions, and lower substrate applicability directly influence the recovery of sugar at a competitive price. Understanding the interaction of the relationship of the enzymes and substrates with the interactions of the reducing cellulase amount and effective hydrolysis rate should be positioned for the recovery of 2G sugar at a competitive price. Thus, effective strategies are needed to minimize cellulase dosage to overcome the cost of the enzyme. Further, on-site enzyme production, the addition of pre-treated biomass in fed-batch mode, and the washing of pre-treated biomass can play a pivotal role in the economic production of 2G sugar.

Climate warming is caused by the positive radiative imbalances triggered by the accumulated Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. The energy sector accounts for more than 75% of the CO2 emissions. Recycling CO2 to useful molecules is the most desirable path. However, the high thermodynamic stability of CO2 makes this path expensive. The forward Boudouard reaction also called char gasification (C + CO 2 \u2192 2CO) represents a possible method of recycling CO2. This reaction is highly endothermic at relatively low temperatures. The char for the reaction is necessary and available from pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials. Pyrolysis of typical carbonaceous material consist of initial fast devolatilization followed by relatively slow char gasification. Therefore, char gasification with CO2 reduction is the rate limiting step. This review is focused on the recent (2014\u20132020) literature involving acceleration of this important step. Pretreatment of char including the use of microwave heating may be a useful technique.

The work was concerned mainly with the characteristics of the bulking agents used (type and particle size) and their effects on the development of the process and on the potential added value of the composts obtained. For this, four composting piles were prepared using agri-food sludge and two bulking agents (vine shoot prunings and pepper plant pruning waste) at two particle sizes (<1 cm and <3 cm). The evolution of the process and the final properties of the composts obtained were studied using classical analytical methods together with advanced instrumental methods (thermal analysis and excitation\u2013emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy).

Melon plants grown in a mixture which included compost produced using vine pruning waste had a greater shoot weight than those grown on peat alone, while the mixture including compost derived from pepper pruning waste gave a shoot weight similar to that of peat-grown plants. Furthermore, the composts elaborated using vine shoot prunings had added value with respect to their use as growing media components for seedling production of melon, due to their suppression of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis.

The degradation of LDPE film by bacteria was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis for topographical changes such as crack, pits, cavity and roughness. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis of degraded film showed the addition of extra-functional group at the range of 1025\u20131275 cm\u22121 with an increase in C-O stretching that is due to the addition of alcohol (\u2013OH) group, which was further confirmed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of degraded by-products release of fatty acids due to esterase activity. A decrease in tensile strength (0.43 MPa) and thermal weight loss (99.63%) in LDPE degraded by bacterial isolate H-246. Carbon content was also reduced in the bacterial degraded LDPE film from 86.10% to 80.45% for bacterial isolate H-244. All these characteristic changes in polyethylene were occurred due to esterase enzyme production by the bacteria and confirmed by isolation and purification, which showed 32, 32 and 43 KD of molecular weight for bacterial isolate H-244, H-246 and H-248, respectively.

In this study, the rate and extent of mineralization of a wide range of commercially available plastic alternative materials were determined during composting, anaerobic digestion and soil incubation. The biodegradability was assessed by measuring the amount of carbon mineralized from these materials during incubation under conditions that simulate these three environments and by examination of the materials by scanning electron micrography (SEM). The results showed that during a 660 day soil incubation, substantial mineralization was observed for polyhydroxyalkanoate plastics, starch-based plastics and for materials made from compost. However, only a polyhydroxyalkanoate-based plastic biodegraded at a rate similar to the positive control (cellulose). No significant degradation was observed for polyethylene or polypropylene plastics or the same plastics amended with commercial additives meant to confer biodegradability. During anaerobic digestion for 50 days, 20\u201325% of the bio-based materials but less than 2% of the additive containing plastics were converted to biogas (CH4 + CO2). After 115 days of composting, 0.6% of an additive amended polypropylene, 50% of a plastarch material and 12% of a soy wax permeated paper pulp was converted to carbon dioxide. SEM analysis showed substantial disintegration of polyhydroxyalkanoate-based plastic, some surface changes for other bio-based plastics and coconut coir materials but no evidence of degradation of polypropylene or polypropylene containing additives. Although certain bio-based plastics and natural fibers biodegraded to an appreciable extent in the three environments, only a polyhydroxyalkanoate-based resin biodegraded to significant extents during the time scale of composting and anaerobic digestion processes used for solid waste management.", "qas": [{"id": "7249", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "No significant degradation", "answer_start": 1283}, {"text": "degradation", "answer_start": 1298}]}]}, {"context": "A sustainable solvent-free process of the utilization of waste cooking oils has been developed using different types of catalysts.

The most commonly used insulating material in pavements is extruded polystyrene (XPS) boards. However, the utilization of XPS boards has several unavoidable drawbacks such as degradation due to long-term moisture infiltration. For this reason, there is an increasing interest to explore alternative materials such as tire chips, bottom ash, and foamed glass aggregates as the insulation layer. This paper aims to evaluate the potential of using foamed concrete as an insulation layer. To achieve this goal, a thermo-mechanical (TM) coupled model was developed to simulate the responses of insulated pavement with a foamed concrete insulation layer. In addition, the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of different densities of foamed concrete were tested to provide the material parameters for the developed model. The model was then calibrated by a large-scale insulated pavement test. The calibrated model was used for a parametric study to reveal the influence of the thickness, depth, and density of the foamed concrete layer on the thermal and mechanical performance. Simulation results show that the developed model can accurately predict the thermal performance of insulated pavements. Compared with the performance of uninsulated pavements, the foamed concrete -insulated pavement has better performance in resisting frost effect and traffic loading.

Due to technological breakthroughs and changes in environmental conditions, and their material property is one of the variables that influence the degradation of roadway. Several investigations have been conducted by incorporating different materials into pavement structures to achieve longer-lasting and better pavement infrastructures than those at present. Sustainability benefits, workability, low prices, time, and structural capacity are factors that have been widely focused. This study focuses on the raw materials, production techniques, types, and properties of the ULCCs. The boundary densities of the ULCCs were considered from 400 to 1600 kg/m3. Structures all across the globe have benefited from the usage of cellular concrete in some form or another. However, much work in this field should be focused on, particularly in geotechnical applications. Geotechnical applications need specific attention to develop this kind of concrete with enhanced qualities. In order to address this need, this review paper has extensively focused on raw materials, manufacturing procedures, cellular concrete characteristics, types and uses of ULCC, particularly in geotechnical applications.

Furthermore, the low gas emissions and the utilization of waste materials increase the importance of alkali-activated lightweight concrete. In this chapter, the strengths of lightweight concrete were examined by considering the aggregate type and density, the alkali activator type and concentration, the type of fiber reinforcements and foaming agents, which are the factors that have the most impact on the strengths. Thermal conductivity, fire resistance, acoustic performance, and durability properties have been explained considering the key points in the literature. In addition to porosity, it has been determined that one of the most important factors directly affecting the fire resistance is the precursor type. It has been concluded that the fire resistance of the concrete prepared by using K-based precursors is higher. Acoustic performances of alkali-activated lightweight concrete vary. It is necessary to use a high amount of aggregate in order to obtain concretes with wide frequency ranges and high absorption coefficient.

Analysis of products composition indicated that catalytic cracking of LDPE generally produced high amount of aliphatic branched-chain compounds, together with moderate amount of cyclic compounds. The reaction conditions also led to alkylation of benzene by the cracking products from LDPE.

The better performance in the presence of biochar is due to both galvanic interactions between biochar and solid waste. The biochemical characterization of bioleaching solution suggested that the high concentration of biochar (> 1.6 g/L) led to copper absorption by functional groups on the surface of biochar.

Maintaining the stability and high catalytic activity of CA is challenging. Immobilization provides an effective route that can improve enzymatic stability. Through the interaction of covalent bonds and van der Waals forces, water-soluble CA can be combined with various insoluble supports to form water-insoluble immobilized CA so that CA stability and utilization can be greatly improved.

The use of compostable materials for food packaging could be an enabling technology to allow the diversion of food waste from landfills into composting facilities. However, despite many new initiatives and existing programs it is still true that a significant part of industrial and household waste still ends up in landfills. Because polylactide polymers are known to be compostable the question is often raised about the behaviour of these materials in landfills. In order to study the behaviour of Ingeo polylactides (PLA) in landfills two studies were performed aimed at generating reliable information on the anaerobic biodegradation of PLA under conditions of extended time and modest temperatures. The first test (under accelerated landfill conditions) was done at 21 \u00b0C, and three moisture levels, extending to 390 days and the second test (a high solids anaerobic digestion test under optimal and significantly accelerated conditions) was conducted at 35 \u00b0C for 170 days. Each test is meant to represent an accelerated test of what could happen under anaerobic landfill conditions. These two tests each had accelerated the biological degradation sufficiently that they were in some sense equivalent to approximately a century of a \u201ctypical\u201d biologically active landfill. The semicrystalline polylactide samples did not produce a statistically significant quantity of biogas during either test. The amorphous PLA did generate a small amount of biogas in the test at 35 \u00b0C, but none in the test at ambient temperature. Here it should be noted that the tests were conducted under accelerated, optimal landfill conditions, the biodegradation was observed in a 100 year timeframe and the market volume of amorphous PLA is low. We conclude that semicrystalline PLA (typical of >96 wt% of resin used to manufacture products), under anaerobic biological conditions typical of a landfill at moderate temperatures (where PLA hydrolysis is slow), will not lead to significant generation of methane, and that no significant population of organisms is available under anaerobic conditions to directly degrade high molecular weight PLA. Because there was no direct biological degradation of PLA under the anaerobic conditions, it is likely that any degradation of PLA in a landfill would require a chemical hydrolysis step prior to any biodegradation, which is analogous to the situation in aerobic composting. At 20 \u00b0C this process is estimated to take 100+ years, and under those conditions the degradation of the PLA would be extremely low.

However, the relevant reports in wetland ecosystems, the boundary area between water and land, are still rare. Where are the sources and sinks of MPs in the wetland? The latest researches have shown that the sources of MPs in wetlands include sewage discharge, surface runoff, and plastic wastes from aquaculture. Fibers and fragments are the most common shapes, and PE, PP, PS can be detected in water or sediment matrices, and biota of wetlands. The distribution is affected by hydrodynamic conditions, sediment properties, and vegetation coverage. Factors affecting the vertical migration of MPs include their own physical and chemical properties, the combination of substances that accelerate deposition (mineral adsorption and biological flocculation), and resuspension. Minerals tend to adsorb negatively charged MPs while algae aggregates have a preference for positively charged MPs. The wetlands vegetation can trap MPs and affect their migration. In water matrices, MPs are ingested by organisms and integrated into sediments, which makes them seem undetectable in the wetland ecosystem. Photodegradation and microbial degradation can further reduce the MPs in size. Although recent research has increased, we are still searching for a methodological harmonization of the detection practices and exploring the migration rules and fate patterns of MPs.

Research lines focus on environmental remediation, with the detection, removal, and degradation of emerging contaminants. Printed materials serve as molds or supports for the fabrication of microreactional or adsorptive devices, and in the one-step fabrication of devices with photocatalytic or conductive properties. However, the literature reports current challenges in the manufacture of these prototypes, such as the quality of micrometer-scale channels, the need to functionalize the supports, and the complexity in the production process of functional materials in a single step. Among the different techniques, fused deposition modeling (FDM) stands out as the cheapest 3D printing technique, becoming the most popular in these prototypes manufacturing. The main limitation of the FDM process is the manufacture of non-functional parts since the final parts are produced from polymeric filaments such as ABS and PLA. Therefore, the production of functional filaments for 3D printing is an attractive solution to bring functionality to printed parts. This production step is still very challenging, as specific physical properties of the matrix and polymer particles are necessary for printing with adequate performance.

The evaluated alternative fuels were waste plastic oil (WPO), tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO), biodiesel, ammonia, vegetable oil (VO), and waste lubricant oil (WLO). Neat WPO and TPO demonstrated poorer emissions performances than diesel; alternatively, retarding the fuel injection timing of the WPO engine and blending the TPO with biodiesel had elevated engine performances substantially.

Fiber reinforced gypsum showed higher strength (up to 90% higher) and modulus (up to 7%) and also better resistance to moisture. Wool fibers provided substantially higher moisture resistance while coir provided better strength. A blend of the two fibers provided a flame resistance rating of V1 compared to V0 for pure gypsum.

This difference in size brings along a number of problems, mostly engineering problems, but not only.

Moreover, potential of bioaccumulation increases with decreasing of particle size. Although microplastics have been widely investigated in marine systems, very little attention is paid to freshwater systems.

This article reviewed more than 100 peer-reviewed scholarly papers to elucidate the latest advances in the novel application of immobilized enzyme/microorganism complexes for microplastics degradation, its feasibility and future prospects. This review shows that metal nanoparticle-enzyme complexes improve biodegradation of microplastics in most studies through creating photogenerated radicals to facilitate polymer oxidation, accelerating growth of bacterial consortia for biodegradation, anchoring enzymes and improving their stability, and absorbing water for hydrolysis. In a study, the antimicrobial property of nanoparticles retarded the growth of microorganisms, hence biodegradation. Carbon particle-enzyme complexes enable enzymes to be immobilized on carbon-based support or matrix through covalent bonding, adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, and a combination of the mechanisms, facilitated by formation of cross-links between enzymes. These complexes were shown to improve microplastics-degrading efficiency and recyclability of enzymes. Other emerging nanoparticles and/or enzymatic technologies are fusion of enzymes with hydrophobins, polymer binding module, peptide and novel nanoparticles. Nonetheless, the enzymes in the complexes present a limiting factor due to limited understanding of the degradation mechanisms.

Plant polyphenols, as ubiquitous biomass, reveal low cost, nontoxicity, strong metal chelate ability and good adhesive property towards various substrates. Plant polyphenols and their coordination polymers have recently been regarded as a powerful tool for engineering functional nanomaterials. Herein, the recent progress of plant polyphenol-based coordination polymers and their derived functional mesoporous materials have been comprehensively reviewed. Firstly, based on the strong interactions between polyphenols and various assembly units (e.g., metal ions, soft-template) or substrates (e.g., polystyrene sphere), metal-polyphenol coordination polymers (MPCPs) with capsule structure, crystalline framework, colloidal spheres or mesoporous network can be prepared. Secondly, polyphenols are regarded as an excellent sustainable carbon source. When metal-polyphenol coordination polymers are used as a carbon precursor, mesoporous carbon materials including pure carbon, heteroatom doping, or metal nanoparticle loading are prepared. Thirdly, due to the tunable compositions of MPCPs, mesoporous metal oxide spheres with tunable metal species, solid or hollow structure, complex compositions (e.g., multi-metals or high-entropy metal oxides) are prepared. Fourthly, the applications of MPCPs derived mesoporous materials, including energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and biomedicine, have been summarized. Compared with the most commonly used metal\u2013organic frameworks, MPCPs are constructed from renewable plant polyphenols. Most importantly, polyphenols are one kind molecular glue and can interact with various molecules. Various components can be incorporated into the MPCPs. MPCPs can also be deposited on various substrates. After thermal decomposition, functional nanoporous composites and films are obtained.

Experimental data demonstrated that MW heating could be also considered as a preferable choice compared with conventional chemical-physical or heating techniques in treating contaminated soils when soils present natural or enhanced high dielectric features. Analogously, for sediment decontamination processes, only conventional thermal treatments can be similarly effective as MW heating, but requiring high temperatures and costs. Undoubtedly, MW-absorber and irradiated matrix heavily affect the MW effectiveness and energy requirements. In general, the main advantages of MW are very rapid process, selective and environmentally sustainable. This depends on the principle of dielectric heating that allows the activation of effective removal mechanisms, namely selective heating and contaminant stripping by water distillation. However, despite the demonstrated possibility of combining eco-friendly with very high removals, the growth of industrial MW applications is still limited due to the lack of several information, which, at the moment represents difficult challenges. In fact, literature mainly relies on lab-scale experiments, and extending the obtained achievements to full-scale still faces to many problems. This still makes MW rarely applied to real practises. Material characterisation, scaling-up, pilot, modelling, design and demonstration studies are strongly desired to bridge the gap between existing literature and full-scale applications, and moving to industrial/production scale. Then, despite a change of approach being observed especially in the last three years, interdisciplinary future research is strictly required in order to exploit the full potential of MW-techniques.", "qas": [{"id": "7752", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "pyrolysis", "answer_start": 526}, {"text": "conventional pyrolysis", "answer_start": 513}, {"text": "thermal", "answer_start": 866}, {"text": "conventional thermal treatments", "answer_start": 853}]}]}, {"context": "Cracks generated in materials affect comprehensive performance and shorten service life of materials.

Thus, the present study used a microcosm experiment to explore the potential effects of four types of biochar on the chemical and microbial properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MP-contaminated soil under both drought and well-watered conditions. The results show that the biochars altered soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorous, and total exchangeable cations (TEC) with some variability depending on the biochar type.

The application of soft wood pellet biochar (700 \u00b0C) to MP-contaminated soil increased urease activity by 146% under well-watered conditions. OSR-derived biochars significantly reduced soil acid phosphatase activity under both water conditions.

A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined.

The optimal liquid fraction with pre-degradation was obtained at low reaction temperature and catalyst amount respectively, i.e. high polymer to catalyst ratio, making it economically viable method for the degradation of lldPE. The coke content was analysed using TGA in nitrogen atmosphere to remove the soft coke and then in air isothermally at the final temperature to burn the hard coke. The TGA results of the coked sample show less concentration of coke components on the catalyst using the pre-degradation method as compared to the normal mixing which shows high concentration of coke components especially at low reaction temperature. Moreover, the majority of the coke components produced using the pre-degradation method were soft coke, making it more efficient for the re-usability of the catalyst.

The ultrafiltration performance of the (un)irradiated Psf and MMMs reveal that an optimum reinforcement of GZO at 1 (w/wPsf)% offers ~10 times radiation resistant MMM, compared to that of Psf membrane. The MMM with 1 (w/wPsf)% GZO was rolled into 2512 spiral configuration and a highly-compact device was developed for treatment of radioactive effluent. Based on the flux decline behaviour over 18 months duration, the fouling behaviour of the MMM module was modelled.
