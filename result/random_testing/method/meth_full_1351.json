It is highlighted that there is confusion with nomenclature, with chemical recycling and feedstock recycling being used interchangeably to mean the processes of pyrolysis, gasification, hydrocracking or depolymerization of plastic waste. However, the two terms are rarely mentioned together. This causes inconsistency and a lack of visibility in the literature, confusion over term definitions and which term to use.

The direct comparison of chemical recycling methods and mechanical recycling is no longer valuable. Chemical recycling supports mechanical recycling by recycling plastic waste, which is not mechanically recycled, therefore there is no need to determine which method is best. Pyrolysis is the most researched chemical recycling method, as well as being the most common method modelled using LCA. Pyrolysis is often highlighted as the best chemical recycling method.

This is followed by a brief description of how the LCA methodology has been embraced by the pavement community, and the presentation of concepts, methodological, and operational aspects related to the application of LCA to waste management systems. A conceptual example of a consequential LCA case study is then presented to investigate the potential environmental consequences of utilizing plastic recyclates in place of virgin aggregates in the production of asphalt mixtures. This chapter then concludes with current challenges and open issues related to advanced LCA modeling aspects and opportunities for increasing the use of plastic recyclates in asphalt pavements. While the presented fundamentals of LCA modeling of recycled materials and pavements will be valuable for young researchers and practitioners, the explanation of consequential, and attributional LCA modeling approaches can provide interesting insights for advanced users.

Chemical recycling technologies based on pyrolysis and gasification are leading the way because of their robustness and good economics, but an improved understanding of the chemistry and more innovative reactor designs are required to realize a potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of more than 100 million tonnes of CO2-eq., primarily by more efficient use of valuable natural resources. The feed flexibility of thermal processes supports the potential of pyrolysis and gasification, however, the strong variability in time and space of blending partners such as multiple and co-polymers, additives, and contaminants (such as inorganic materials) calls for accurate assessment through fundamental experiments and models. Such complex and variable mixtures are strongly sensitive to the process design and conditions: temperature, residence time, heating rates \u2013 severity, mixing level, heat and mass transfer strongly affect the thermal degradation of SPW and its selectivity to valuable products. A prerequisite in improving design and performance is the ability to model conversion profiles and product distributions based on accurate rate coefficients for the dominating reaction families established using first-principle derived transport and thermodynamic properties. These models should also help with the \u201cdesign for recycling\u201d strategy to increase recyclability, for example by identifying additives that make chemical recycling difficult. Fundamental experiments of increased quality (accuracy, integrity, validity, replicability, completeness) together with improved deterministic kinetic models, systematically developed according to the reaction classes and rate rules approach, provide insights to identify optimal process conditions. This will allow shedding some light upon the important pathways involved in the thermal degradation of the feedstock and the formation/disappearance of desired or unwanted products. In parallel, the intrinsic kinetics of the dominating elementary reaction steps should be determined with higher accuracy, moving beyond single step kinetics retrieved from thermogravimetric analysis experiments. Together with more accurate kinetic parameters, better models to account for heat and mass transfer limitations also need to be further developed, since plastic degradation involves at least three phases (solid, liquid, gas), whose interactions should be accounted for in a more rigorous way.

This paper compares the economic performance of the pyrolysis of mixed polyolefin waste in a closed-loop and open-loop scheme, including a probabilistic approach to the most important variables.

Yet, in a future scenario where decarbonized electricity would decrease oil prices, the probability of a positive outcome reduces to 57% for the open-loop case and to less than 8% in the case of closed-loop recycling.

Lessons drawn from Taiwan's prowess in resources recovery are presented to inspire a transformation of its waste sector towards a digitalization. The implications of digitalization on the city's waste recycling industry are elaborated. Before applying digitalization, St. Petersburg encountered challenges such as a lack of proper infrastructure in waste management, low public participation and environmental awareness, technological gaps, and insufficient coordination among its institutions. As one of the world's leaders in waste recycling (65%), Taiwan was selected as a role model for St. Petersburg in improving its waste management. The Island's daily per capita rate decreased by 96% to 0.4 kg in 2015. Taiwan also minimized the amount of waste disposal into landfills to less than 2%, while 80% of its industrial waste was recycled. About 33% of annual waste generation in Taiwan was reduced through \u201cPay-as-you-throw\u201d policy. The average volume of municipal solid waste generation per capita decreased by 20% to 0.91 kg/day.

Nearly 1.3 billion metric tonnes of plastic are produced annually as businesses strive to meet the demands of consumers. Plastic is made through a process called polymerization, in which hydrocarbons are rearranged into new molecules. These hydrocarbons often have a high molecular mass, and they may also contain other chemicals to boost their performance. Plastic is a useful material because, among other things, it is durable, lasts a long time, is inexpensive, and has many other benefits. Because plastic can take decades to degrade if left alone, effective waste plastic disposal should be a top priority for every-one. Yet, growing industrialization and urbanization have contributed to a discernible rise in fuel demand. Finding renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels is now a critical global priority. Plastics-to-gasoline conversion provides a means to solve both of these problems.

While recycling of FRP is environmentally desirable, almost all existing recycling methods, which are based on either thermal, chemical or mechanical processes, are economically unviable if governmental subsides are not available.

The mechanical properties of MFRC were investigated. The test results showed that the addition of macro fibres had two major effects on the concrete: (1) the workability of concrete depends strongly on the macro fibre volume ratio, with the slump value reducing from 176 mm to 83 mm as the macro fibre volume ratio increased from 0% to 1.5%; (2) the flexural strength and toughness of the concrete be greatly enhanced by the addition of macro fibres, e.g., by 1.3 and 230 times when the macro fire value ratio was 1.5%.

Common FRP composites are normally thermoset and non-biodegradable, posing a significant environmental threat if they are not disposed of properly at their end of life. While recycling of FRP is environmentally desirable, almost all existing recycling methods, which are based on either thermal, chemical or mechanical processes, are economically unviable if governmental subsides are not available. The recycling of glass FRP (GFRP) waste, which accounts for over 95% of all types of FRP waste by weight, is even more economically challenging than the recycling of carbon FRP (CFRP) waste due to the lesser economic value of the former. This paper explores a novel mechanical method for recycling GFRP waste by processing it into macro fibres for reinforcing concrete, with the resulting material referred to as macro fibre reinforced concrete (MFRC). The mechanical properties of MFRC were investigated. The test results showed that the addition of macro fibres had two major effects on the concrete: (1) the workability of concrete depends strongly on the macro fibre volume ratio, with the slump value reducing from 176 mm to 83 mm as the macro fibre volume ratio increased from 0% to 1.5%; (2) the flexural strength and toughness of the concrete be greatly enhanced by the addition of macro fibres, e.g., by 1.3 and 230 times when the macro fire value ratio was 1.5%.

The contribution of the solvent to the depolymerization reaction was mainly the dissolution and dispersion of feedstock by solvation, therefore reducing thermal cracking temperature through enhanced mass and thermal energy transfer. In thermal liquefaction, solvent and feedstock had a low level of solvolysis reactions, so the depolymerization reaction mainly follows thermal cracking.

By compiling thirty-seven (37) articles by bibliometric analysis constrained by the condition of at least one characterization technique used to characterize wax, a t-test was used to compare the physicochemical properties of pyrolysis and commercial waxes statistically.

These differences suggest that the o term wax must be used only for materials recovered from polyolefin pyrolysis matching the required characteristics of commercial waxes; otherwise, the most suitable term is the waxy matter or waxy product. The assessment outcomes revealed that there is no protocol for selecting a specific combo of characterization techniques as the minimum necessary to establish the quality of waxes recovered from pyrolysis.

The results show that using basalt fibres significantly improves the concrete mechanical performance not only at room temperature but also after a thermal cycle, even for a small fibre content (less than 4 kg/m3).

This study evaluates the use of a very common and largely available soft plastic - recycled linear low-density polyethylene (R-LLDPE) - for modification of bitumen. To assess its applicability in the road sector, the base bitumen and R-LLDPE modified bitumen blends were compared through physical, chemical, rheological and thermal evaluation. It was observed that due the addition of high concentrations of R-LLDPE the viscosity and softening point were increased from 0.62 Pa s and 44.1 \u00b0C up to 5.75 Pa s and 122.3 \u00b0C, respectively, whereas the penetration value decreased from 59.3 to 14.3 (0.1 mm). A progressive increase in viscosity with increasing concentration of R-LLDPE indicates substantial reduction in workability due to the greater polymer-dominant phase. An increase in the intensities of peaks and the absence of new peaks during Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis confirms the successful blending of the recycled polymer into the bitumen matrix. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the modified bitumen had less evaporation and higher thermal stability than base bitumen. The rheological evaluation highlighted how the R-LLDPE addition significantly affected the thermo-susceptibility of the bitumen and improved the resistance to permanent deformation at high temperature and elastic recovery. Based on the overall findings of this study, it can be stated that R-LLDPE \u2013 if dosed correctly and sourced from homogeneous sources \u2013 can enhance the overall bitumen performance without significant drawbacks.

Recycling magnesium waste into magnesium hydroxide (MH) aerogels has been successfully developed to partially solve the problem of magnesium waste. The effects of the Mg concentration on the properties of the MH aerogel have been investigated. The MH aerogel exhibits a porous structure with a low density of 0.081\u20130.150\u202fg cm\u22123 and a high porosity of 91.5\u201394.4 %. Its thermal conductivity and stability are evaluated, showing that the MH aerogel has a good thermal insulation capability with a low thermal conductivity of 30\u201342\u202fmW m-1 \u202fK-1, and it is stable up to 800\u202f\u00b0C for about 50 % weight loss. In addition, its acoustic absorption performance is also investigated. The MH aerogel performs a good acoustic absorption capability at low frequency, and its noise reduction coefficient indicates that the MH aerogel is a potential competitor to other acoustic insulators.

Although liquid oil exhibits comparable heating value with commercial fuel (diesel/petrol), for example higher heating value of Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene (PE) are 50 and 42 MJ/kg which is between 42 and 46 MJ/kg for commercial diesel the other properties depend on several parameters such as plastic and pyrolysis reactor types, temperature, feed size, reaction time, heating rate and catalysts. A techno-economic analysis indicate that the liquid oil production cost could be about 0.6 USD/l if plant capacity is \u2265175,000 million litres/year with a breakeven of 1 year. After-treatment of WPPO through distillation and hydrotreatment is recommended for improving the physio-chemical properties comparable to commercial fuel to use in automobile applications.

The produced pellets have low cost, high heating value, better uniformity, and low environmental impact. They can be used as solid fuels or as feedstock for pyrolysis and gasification. To evaluate the pellet cost and its environmental impact, we performed Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

The actual development and implementation of recycled asphalt pavement in numerous countries in Asia, North America, South America, Europe and Africa are emphasised, and their influence on the performance of asphalt pavements is reviewed. Modified pavement showed satisfying performance for years as maintenance and restoration are not required. Generally, solid wastes are required to undergo pre-requisite treatments via mechanical, biological stabilization, thermal or chemical methods before the implementation as asphalt modifiers to ease the handling process. Moisture damage issues have been spotted in the implementation of several types of solid wastes and consequently reduced the strength and durability of pavement. Therefore, potential hydrophobic treatment can be adopted to improve the quality of asphalt mixtures by modifying the hydrophilic characteristics that are contributed by the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) or providing a superhydrophobic coating onto the particles.

The actual development and implementation of recycled asphalt pavement in numerous countries in Asia, North America, South America, Europe and Africa are emphasised, and their influence on the performance of asphalt pavements is reviewed. Modified pavement showed satisfying performance for years as maintenance and restoration are not required. Generally, solid wastes are required to undergo pre-requisite treatments via mechanical, biological stabilization, thermal or chemical methods before the implementation as asphalt modifiers to ease the handling process. Moisture damage issues have been spotted in the implementation of several types of solid wastes and consequently reduced the strength and durability of pavement. Therefore, potential hydrophobic treatment can be adopted to improve the quality of asphalt mixtures by modifying the hydrophilic characteristics that are contributed by the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) or providing a superhydrophobic coating onto the particles. The treatments greatly weakened the moisture sensitivity of modified materials by reducing their water absorption and increasing their water contact angle.

Meanwhile, their ever-growing usage significantly strains the present-day waste management measures such as landfilling and incineration, resulting in large quantities of used face-covering masks landing in the environment as importunate contaminants.

In fact, the incorporation of waste and/or by-products into polymer composites may represent a new resource and a successful approach to materials suitable for specific applications that promote a circular economy approach. According to this study, there is a considerable amount of research on the application of solid wastes, in particular agricultural wastes, as fillers for thermoplastic and thermoset matrices to obtain composites suitable for application in components subjected to light to moderate loads. As a main drawback, surface pre-treatment is necessary in many cases to increase the adhesion between matrix and fillers and the final mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of polymer composites.", "qas": [{"id": "701", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "thermal", "answer_start": 1660}, {"text": "final mechanical, thermal, chemical properties", "answer_start": 1715}]}]}, {"context": "The utilization of plastic material is huge and consistently developing in the perspective on the favourable position got from the adaptability, minimal effort and tough.

This study focuses on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which has a broad application window and its recycling is therefore environmentally and economically favorable and sustainable. Therefore, this study involves the thermal and mechanical behavior of recycled PET after extrusion and 3D printing. The extrusion parameters are optimized by performing a complete physico-chemical and thermal analysis of the obtained filaments and they were compared with commercial virgin and recycled PET. Moreover, the influence of the applied processing conditions on the degree of crystallinity and mechanical properties is investigated. The filaments are then used for FFF, where various printing parameters are altered to obtain the optimum printing conditions (i.e. printing temperature, the build plate temperature, fan cooling and printing directions). The effect of the degree of crystallinity of semi-crystalline PET is investigated via altered printing parameters, showing superior mechanical properties for an increasing degree of crystallinity. To verify the portability of the obtained optimized print parameters, two different FFF printers are used.

The results showed that P E T o i l - t r e a t e d granules are more compatible with bitumen than are C R o i l - t r e a t e d granules, as evidenced by a lower separation index and a lower softening-point difference observed for P E T o i l - t r e a t e d bitumen. P E T o i l - t r e a t e d bitumen showed the higher viscosity and recovery; P E T o i l - t r e a t e d bitumen increased the recovery by 47.36%, while no effect on the elasticity was seen when introducing the C R o i l - t r e a t e d into bitumen. The results also showed that bitumen containing P E T o i l - t r e a t e d had better resistance to permanent deformation, while bitumen containing C R o i l - t r e a t e d showed better resistance to fatigue cracking.

Accordingly, as far as buildings in earthquake-prone areas are concerned, damage limitation under seismic loads must be ensured while paying attention on the issues related to the environmental sustainability of the construction, ranging from its ecological footprint to the thermal efficiency. Masonry infills in framed reinforced concrete buildings are especially important in this context. In fact, they are vulnerable to earthquakes and greatly impact on the environmental sustainability of the building because they employ a significant amount of construction materials and influence its energy consumption throughout the lifetime. In light of this, the main novelty of the present work is concerned with a new deformable joint for masonry infills in framed reinforced concrete buildings. A detailed description of such innovative system for masonry infills is provided, together with numerical and experimental investigations about its mechanical and thermal behavior. The proposed joint is made of recycled plastic material, namely Regenerated Polypropylene Homopolymer. Geometry and manufacturing process of the proposed joint are initially described. Then, stress\u2013strain relationships for the plastic material are obtained from uniaxial tensile tests at different temperatures. An assembly of fired hollow clay bricks and plastic joints is also tested under in-plane cyclic load, and a phenomenological model is thus proposed to simulate the experimental hysteretic behavior.

Several processes have been developed to recycle PE, but current data gaps exist on the impact of adding post-consumer recycled polyethylene (PCRPE) to different virgin feedstocks on final product performance. To better understand this impact, a single source of PCRPE was melt blended with four different virgin PE grades at different concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 wt% of PCRPE), and changes in the physical, thermal, and mechanical properties were evaluated. Different trends and behaviors were observed depending on the PE density, however, most properties still followed the Law of Mixtures. For example, low-density PE's mechanical strength improved up to 70% increase in tensile modules and 56% in yield strength. The density was increased by ~5%, and no toxic heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb) were found, with less than 4 ppm of Al, Fe, and Ti detected. The insights obtained when mixing polyethylene of different densities with a single recycled grade PE allows plastic manufacturers and recyclers to gain a more comprehensive view of possibilities associated with PCRPE.

In the U.S., on a cradle-to-gate, per unit mass waste basis, producing fuel is lower-emitting than producing LDPE from pyrolysis. The opposite is true in the EU. But expanding the system boundary to the grave results in LDPE as the lower-emitting product in both regions. Naphtha and LDPE produced from non-recyclable plastics are less GHG-intensive than conventional routes to these products.

Gel-casting technique is known as an eco-friendly method for making glass foams by vigorous mechanical foaming. In gel-casting, the pore structure of the foam is initially stabilized by gelation of alkali-activated precursors and then strengthened by viscous flow sintering. However, the gelation process requires a prolonged activation and precuring processes of precursors at a raised temperature which is not energy-efficient. Therefore, this research aimed to reduce the gelation time and improve the pore characteristics in glass foams by a novel combined mechanical and chemical foaming technique. After quick alkali-activation of precursors and foaming, the hardened glass foams were sintered at 700\u2013800\u00b0C temperatures.

Glass foams are porous, lightweight materials and are extensively used in various industry sectors. Gel-casting technique is known as an eco-friendly method for making glass foams by vigorous mechanical foaming. In gel-casting, the pore structure of the foam is initially stabilized by gelation of alkali-activated precursors and then strengthened by viscous flow sintering. However, the gelation process requires a prolonged activation and precuring processes of precursors at a raised temperature which is not energy-efficient. Therefore, this research aimed to reduce the gelation time and improve the pore characteristics in glass foams by a novel combined mechanical and chemical foaming technique. After quick alkali-activation of precursors and foaming, the hardened glass foams were sintered at 700\u2013800\u00b0C temperatures. It is concluded that the lengthy gelation process can be replaced by quick activation and combined foaming technique to develop desirable pore characteristics. The low-speed mechanical foaming imposes low shearing stress on the activated paste, which reduces pore coalescing. Additionally, chemical foaming by low-concentration hydrogen peroxide reduces anisotropic pore formation. Consequently, the pore structure in glass foam improves.

Meanwhile, to promote recycling, pure green buildings campaign and natural resources conservation, biobased PCMs (bPCMs) are preferable over orthodox PCMs. The major characteristics of bPCMs that make them a preferred choice for TES applications include but are not limited to renewability, non-toxicity, minimal supercooling, high latent heat, thermal stability over a wider temperature range, reasonable melting/freezing temperatures, self-nucleating response, and limited flammability. Despite these advantages, there are different challenges attached to bPCMs that hinder their application on large scale i.e., biodegradability, odor generation, leakage, and demand-supply issues. However, most of these limitations are analogous to that of conventional PCMs, and promising research data is available on their solution. Further, the conventional source of bPCMs includes biobased oils and fats, most of which are of edible nature; thus, their widespread use could conflict with food security and undermine the major advantages of bPCMs. This issue can be resolved by minimizing the reliance of bPCM on conventional sources and looking for viable alternatives i.e., waste edible oils, animal fats, and genetically modified oils. Albeit strong evidence can be found in the literature about the viability of these alternatives, they are open to research. Further, life cycle assessment of different bPCMs also advocates their environment-friendliness and cost-effectiveness over conventional PCMs. Moreover, substantial technological advancements have been made referring to the incorporation of bPCMs in building envelops and TES applications; however, more studies are required on recyclable encapsulation and support materials.

Five waste LCA models were evaluated, the model defaults for the LCI, LCIA, and technical assumptions related to recycling, landfilling, and combustion were used. The recycling/combustion default assumptions were relatively similar amongst models compared to their landfill defaults. For recycling, the assumption of a forest carbon credit for paper products (applied in WARM) resulted in an environmental offset and in different outcomes than other models. The major differences for landfilling resulted from landfill gas management and energy recovery defaults, with MSW-DST associated with the most conservative collection efficiencies and no energy conversion which resulted in the greatest environmental footprints compared to other models, especially SWOLF and EASETECH. While for combustion the major difference amongst models was the inclusion of non-ferrous metal ash recovery.

These wastes are harmful to human beings as well as the aquatic environment. The management of this type of waste generation is very necessary for its disposal. Numerous techniques have been established for the management of a particular phase (type) of hazardous waste through physical, chemical, biological, and thermal treatments. Source reduction is the first step of hazardous waste management by material processing and process design. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) data show that recycling and treatment ratios are too small compared to the land-disposed (16.1\u201325.4MT) of the waste during 2001\u20132015. Uncontrolled and untreated hazardous waste disposed through landfills may cause several health issues. Therefore, reuse and recycling join source reduction to eliminate hazardous waste by using it as a raw material for other processes. Also, developing techniques to recover useful materials from waste is another way to reduce or manage waste. Hazardous waste may be in solid, liquid, or gas substances, depending upon the sources of generation, and every phase has a different methodology to treat that particular waste.               The physical methods of treatment include stripping, electrostatic precipitation, activated carbon absorbing, and leaching. The chemical treatment methods include neutralization, precipitation, solidification, immobilization, chemical oxidation, and reduction. These methods are used to change the chemical composition of waste into nonhazardous material, which is further treated for safe disposal. The biological treatment of hazardous waste is an acceptable, lower-cost method that includes aerobic and anaerobic systems, activated sludge, trickling filters, spray irrigation, rotating biocontractors, and waste stabilization ponds. These methods are mainly used to degrade industrial organic recalcitrant emerging pollutants in the water to short out the effluents for safe disposal as per World Health Organization norms.

These wastes are harmful to human beings as well as the aquatic environment. The management of this type of waste generation is very necessary for its disposal. Numerous techniques have been established for the management of a particular phase (type) of hazardous waste through physical, chemical, biological, and thermal treatments. Source reduction is the first step of hazardous waste management by material processing and process design. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) data show that recycling and treatment ratios are too small compared to the land-disposed (16.1\u201325.4MT) of the waste during 2001\u20132015. Uncontrolled and untreated hazardous waste disposed through landfills may cause several health issues. Therefore, reuse and recycling join source reduction to eliminate hazardous waste by using it as a raw material for other processes. Also, developing techniques to recover useful materials from waste is another way to reduce or manage waste. Hazardous waste may be in solid, liquid, or gas substances, depending upon the sources of generation, and every phase has a different methodology to treat that particular waste.               The physical methods of treatment include stripping, electrostatic precipitation, activated carbon absorbing, and leaching. The chemical treatment methods include neutralization, precipitation, solidification, immobilization, chemical oxidation, and reduction. These methods are used to change the chemical composition of waste into nonhazardous material, which is further treated for safe disposal. The biological treatment of hazardous waste is an acceptable, lower-cost method that includes aerobic and anaerobic systems, activated sludge, trickling filters, spray irrigation, rotating biocontractors, and waste stabilization ponds. These methods are mainly used to degrade industrial organic recalcitrant emerging pollutants in the water to short out the effluents for safe disposal as per World Health Organization norms. Another well-known technique for reducing hazardous waste is thermal treatment, which is mainly used for the recovery of heavy metals from hazardous waste under a substoichiometric environment in a rotary kiln; it also involves the incineration of the hazardous waste. Although the thermal process is more expensive than other methods, it is more viable and is used in many countries across the globe.

Results show that primary waste separation produces material with under 7% of contaminants and secondary manual waste separation efficiency ranges between 45% and 55%. Physico-chemical comparison of simulated RDF strongly coincides with analysed properties of RDF as a final product which indicates very high separation efficiency in the RDF production.

In this review, the physicochemical characteristics of three lignocellulosic wastes, including municipal solid waste, forestry waste, and crop straw, are summarized. Then, the mechanism and influencing factors of biogas production from these wastes through anaerobic digestion are presented. Biological pretreatment techniques have been confirmed to increase lignocellulose hydrolysis and then enhance biogas production, among them, co-culture systems, metabolic engineering and anaerobic co-digestion are worthy of focus in future research. Furthermore, natural lignocellulose degrading systems, like xylophagous insects and ruminants, also have potential for improving the anaerobic digestion system. This review also considers the future perspective of anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic wastes, including kinetics and model studies to optimize anaerobic digestion process, and policy to facilitate biogas production from lignocellulosic wastes.

On this basis, a finite element model of the composite frame which considered the constitutive properties of recycled concrete was established. The deformation diagram, stress nephogram and calculated skeleton curves of composite frame were obtained, and a nonlinear parameter analysis was also conducted. The experimental and numerical analysis results all show that the plastic hinges appeared at the end of steel beams firstly and then formed at the end of columns, which is a typical plastic hinge failure of frame.

The advantages of the first method are its ability to avoid the problems of endogeneity and serial correlation, while the second method is applied to check the robustness of the results and to disclose whether the data set suffers from outliers. All estimators used consistently identified the inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and mismanaged e-waste, as postulated by the EKC hypothesis: quantities of mismanaged e-waste increase along economic growth up to a certain economic development stage (turning point), but then mismanaged e-waste quantities decline while economy continues to grow.

The thermogravimetric analysis revealed that macromolecular substances (Wmas) in WCO has better thermal stability. Combined with the results of separation test, Wmas has better compatibility with asphalt. Subsequently, the study of the physical, rheological and chemical properties was conducted for asphalt with three different aging degrees after regeneration by Wmas. The experimental results show that the adequate distribution of Wmas in the asphalt makes the aging asphalt soften effectively. Moreover, the rejuvenated asphalt exhibits superior high and low temperature rheological properties. However, the physical and rheological properties of the three aged asphalts differ in the rapidity of recovery and the dosage of Wmas. Meanwhile, the excessive dosing of Wmas will cause negative effects, such as a sharp decrease in viscosity and slow change in ductility of the asphalt. In addition, functional groups of rejuvenated asphalt show that Wmas does not react chemically with asphalt. The regeneration of aged asphalt by Wmas depends on its physical compatibility with asphalt and thermal stability.

Hence, there has been an exponential increase in plastic waste generation, which has since been recognised as a global environmental threat. Plastic wastes have adversely affected life on earth, primarily through their undesirable accumulation in landfills, leaching into the soil, increased greenhouse gas emission, etc. Even more damaging is their impact on the aquatic ecosystems as they cause entanglement, ingestion and intestinal blockage in aquatic animals. Furthermore, plastics, especially in the microplastic form, have also been found to interfere with chemical interaction between marine organisms, to cause intrinsic toxicity by leaching, and by absorbing persistent organic contaminants as well as pathogens. The current methods for eliminating these wastes (incineration, landfilling, and recycling) come at massive costs, are unsustainable, and put more burden on our environment. Thus, recent focus has been placed more on the potential of biological systems to degrade synthetic plastics. In this regard, some insects, bacteria and fungi have been shown to ingest these polymers and convert them into environmentally friendly carbon compounds.

Currently, researchers have moved their concern toward green pretreatment methods, including enzymatic techniques and biological decomposition purposes. Among biological sources, the fungal fermentation system has offered a more efficient and sophisticated method because of higher production of bioproducts, greater efficiency, environmentally safe, and cost-effectiveness compared to previous methods.

Waste oils are the optimal raw materials to produce biofuels due to their high hydrogen and volatile matter content. However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament. The bio-oil produced by the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high yield and HHV with great potential to replace fossil fuel, but contains a high acid value of about 120 mg KOH/g. Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio-oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, co-pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio-oil yield and quality.

Methods Characterization of samples were collected during the rainy season from June-August 2020 and January-March 2021 from three discrete socio-economic classes (lower income class [Rs. 15,000 (US $100)], middle-income class [Rs. 50,000 (US $350)] and high-income class [Rs. \u22651,00,000 (US $1,000)]) and segregated into 13 different physical components consisting of organic waste, yard waste, wood, cardboard, textile, plastic, paper, metal, rubber, glass, ceramic, diapers, dust, stone and miscellaneous. Significant Findings More than 70% of the overall generated solid waste was shared by organic waste in the study area, comprising 64.75% moisture content on average. Among all the physical elements of solid waste, combustible content was estimated at 37% in dry mass with 19.23% of ash content and 80.77% of the volatile organic compound. The results of the study approximate about 27.18 MW of energy generation from the available combustible fraction of 1,155 t of domestic solid waste generated from the city daily which can fulfil the need of almost 5,00,000 houses having an average usage of 500 W electricity on monthly basis. The study concludes the conversion of solid waste into energy is the suitable practice for solid waste generated but needed to make this solution practicable with the help of government officials with the involvement of appropriate private sector which will definitely generate new jobs for unemployed persons.

Researchers are developing Mg matrix composites using various reinforcements and expanding the use of Mg-based materials. The conventional reinforcements are Al2O3, SiC, B4C, TiB2, CNT, and GNPs for the production of Mg matrix composites. Researchers have been trying to reduce the cost of Mg matrix composites in recent years by using cheaper and environmentally friendly reinforcements. These reinforcements are solid wastes such as eggshell, fly ash, red mud, and waste glass, and their use in composite systems is becoming more common day by day.

Meanwhile, large amounts of domestic wastes such as waste glass are causing serious environmental issues due to their nonbiodegradable characteristic. Thus, recycling waste glass is a sustainable way to mitigate the environmental problem, conserve natural materials, minimize landfill spaces, and save energy during the recycling production process. This paper experimentally studied the effect of using waste glass powder (WGP) as an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) supplementary material on the paste specimens at ambient temperature and after exposure to high temperatures (800 \u00b0C, 1000 \u00b0C, and 1200 \u00b0C). The physical-mechanical properties such as workability, setting time, compressive strength, and bonding strength of the OPC paste samples containing different mass contents of WGP (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) were investigated and discussed. The potential alkaline aggregate reaction (ASR) effect of WGP on OPC was investigated by the accelerated mortar-bar method. The results show that the addition of WGP contributed to the workability but led to prolonged setting time of the OPC paste. On the other hand, the introduction of WGP in OPC mitigated the degradation of the OPC matrix under high temperatures and could reduce the ASR effect. Therefore, the WGP could be regarded as a feasible SCM to OPC to improve the safety of OPC-based structures both at ambient and under high temperatures.", "qas": [{"id": "1349", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "degradation", "answer_start": 1342}, {"text": "degradation", "answer_start": 1342}]}]}, {"context": "Biobased sustainable hybrid photocatalyts which can efficiently remove the effluent dye in wastewater and be recycled through simple operation without generating secondary waste is highly needed to protect the natural environment.

The two biobased hybrid photocatalysts are systematically characterized and the photocatalytic activity and recyclability for degradation of methylene blue (MB) are compared. Since DRWF shows higher porosity and SSA than TWF, DRWF@V2O5 displays higher MB adsorption ability and degradation efficiency than TWF@V2O5 (51.6% vs 45.2%). After 10 cycles of photocatalyst, though DRWF@V2O5 remains lower photocatalytic activity than TWF@V2O5 (35.7% vs 38.7%), it shows more robust strength than TWF@V2O5. By comparison the photocatalytic activity and recyclability of DRWF@V2O5 and TWF@V2O5 with photocatalysts prepared in previous works, it was found that the photocatalyst prepared in this work are superior.

It is also one of the \"big five\" recyclable plastics with well-established procedures. In many textile and film products, flame retardants (FRs) are added to PET for fire-safe applications. However, PET/FR products are often not designed for recycling, and downgrade during thermomechanical recycling due to polymer degradation. To address this issue, we study the behavior of PET containing phosphorus FRs during and after thermomechanical recycling. Two phosphorus FRs, namely DOPO-PEPA (DP) and Aflammit PCO 900 (AF), are added to PET by extrusion. The compounds are then studied by a comprehensive set of thermal, rheological, and chemical experiments to investigate their thermal, thermo-oxidative, and thermo-mechanical degradation mechanisms. The results indicate the high potential of DP to add enhanced lubrication, and control melt rheology over long periods by stabilization. On the other hand, AF can boost chain extensions and branching in PET, which can counter chain scissions to some extent. A chemical mechanism is proposed suggesting that both FRs can release active radicals and moieties that either quench other radicals such as oxygen radicals, or initiate a reaction with the PET chains leading to chain scissions and/or branching. Finally, a thermomechanical recycling process is simulated by reprocessing the PET compounds in extrusion and injection molding. The mechanical performance of the compounds before and after recycling is studied in tensile experiments. PET/DP samples preserve their ductile tensile behavior after recycling, whereas PET/AF samples become completely brittle. This work motivates future research on the synthesis of new phosphorus FRs based on mixed chemical characteristics of DP and AF for improved recyclability of PET/FR products.", "qas": [{"id": "1351", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "thermal", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "superior mechanical, thermal, barrier properties", "answer_start": 1937}, {"text": "degradation", "answer_start": 468}, {"text": "polymer degradation", "answer_start": 460}, {"text": "thermal, thermo-oxidative, thermo-mechanical degradation mechanisms", "answer_start": 1937}, {"text": "thermal, rheological, chemical experiments", "answer_start": 1937}]}]}]
