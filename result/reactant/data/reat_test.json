[{"context": "Rivers play a crucial role in transporting land-based plastic waste to the ocean, with the Ganges reported as the second largest contributing river of plastic pollution globally. To better quantify global plastic pollution transport and effectively reduce the sources and risks imposed, a clear understanding of the origin, transport, fate, and effects of riverine plastic debris is important. In this review paper, we discuss the current state of knowledge of plastic pollution in aquatic systems in Bangladesh and evaluate existing research gaps. Bangladesh has been recognized as an internationally significant nation in the plastic pollution crisis, but this paper identifies a major disconnect in knowledge, understanding and capacity to understand and address this critical environmental and public health issue. Here, we review all available scientific publications on plastic pollution in the freshwater and marine environment in Bangladesh and identify key research themes. A total of 24 studies relevant to plastic pollution were published from 2006 to 2019, of which 18 were selected for this study under the authors\u2019 criteria. Nine focused on plastic pollution in the marine environment, eight focused on plastic waste generation and management and only one focused on the freshwater environment. We compared our findings with three other countries in the Global South with comparable per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and mismanaged waste, namely Cambodia, Kenya, and Tanzania, revealing similar knowledge gaps. This lack of research demonstrates a need for further work to monitor and model riverine plastic transport and examine the implications for aquatic organisms.

Since the SFM behaves as a semi-liquid between 115.5 and 160 \u00b0C, which is in the range of HMA mixing and paving temperature, it can function as a binding agent to glue the aggregates. When the pavement is cooled down to ambient temperature, the hardened SFM can provide stability and stiffness to HMA.

Large-scale production and applications of plastics increase their possibility of entering the environment. Previous environmental impact studies typically focused on the toxicity, behavior and fate; limited attention was paid on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. With the increase of plastic waste, the threat of plastic pollution to the earth\u2019s climate has been gradually taken seriously. Evidence showed that greenhouse gas emissions occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, including extraction and transportation of plastic raw materials, plastic manufacturing, waste treatment and entering the environment. The oil and gas industries used to make plastics are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions (from the extraction of raw materials to the manufacture of plastics). Emissions of greenhouse gases during manufacture are mainly controlled by the production facilities themselves, usually depending on the efficiency, configuration and service life of equipment. Additionally, there are some unintended impacts, including transport requirements, pipeline leakage, land use, as well as impeding forests as natural carbons sinks. Recycling of plastic waste energy seems to be a good way to deal with waste plastics, but this process will release a lot of greenhouse gases. With this energy conversion occurring, the incineration of plastic packing waste will become one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, plastics released into the environment also slowly release greenhouse gases, and the presence of (micro)plastics in the ocean will seriously interfere with the carbon fixation capacity of the ocean. In its current form, greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics will reach 1.34 gigatons per year by 2030 and 2.8 gigatons per year by 2050. This will seriously consume the global remaining carbon budgets, thereby threatening the ability of the global community to keep global temperatures rising by below 1.5 \u00b0C even 2 \u00b0C by 2100. In order to achieve this goal, the total global greenhouse gas emissions must be kept within the remaining carbon budget of 420\u2013570 gigatons. The accumulative greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics may exceed 56 gigatons by 2050 (approximately accounting for 10%\u201313% of the total remaining carbon budget).

As waste, the management of these plastic fractions must comply with the update of the regulation of waste hazard classification (2014, 2017), the publication of a technical standard on management of WEEE (2015), and a restriction of use for decabromodiphenylether in the product regulation (2017). Data of bromine (n=4283) and BFR concentrations (n=98) in plastics from electric and electronic equipment (EEE), and from WEEE processing facilities before and after sorting for bromine in four sites in France have been studied for chemical composition and for regulatory classification. The WEEE was analysed by handheld X-ray fluorescence, and the waste was sorted after shredding, by on-line X-ray transmission for total bromine content (< or > 2000\u202fmg/kg) in small household appliances (SHA), cathode ray tubes (CRT) and flat screens plastics. In equipment (n=347), 15% of the equipment items have no bromine, while 46% have at least one part with bromine, and 39% have all parts brominated. The bromine concentration in plastics is very heterogeneous, found in high concentrations in large household appliance (LHA) plastics, and also found in unexpected product categories, as observed by other authors. Clearly, an unwanted global loop of brominated substances occurs via the international recycling of plastic scrap. In waste (n=65), polybromobiphenyls, polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane were analysed. The most concentrated BFRs are decaBDE (3000\u202fmg/kg) and TBBPA (8000\u202fmg/kg). The bromine concentration of regulated brominated substances was identified in 2014 and 2015 to be up to 86% of total bromine in \u201cold\u201d waste (SHA, CRT), 30\u201350% in \u201cyounger\u201d waste (Flat screens), and a mean of only 8% in recent products (2009\u20132013). Regulated substances are a minority of all the brominated substances and the only practical way to sort is to measure total bromine on-line. The sorting reduces the mean bromine concentration in the \u201cLow Br\u201d fraction in all sites, and reduces the decaBDE concentration to levels below the restricted use limit. After sorting, the concentration in the \u201cHigh Br\u201d fractions exceeds all present or future regulatory limits. In conclusion, sorting of small household appliances, cathode ray tubes and flat screen plastics is necessary to avoid uncontrolled dispersion of regulated substances in recycled raw material. Other categories (large household appliances, electric and electronic tools, lighting equipment) should also be considered, since their total bromine content (unweighted mean concentration) is high for some of these products.

The significant reduction in pollutants such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke were recorded due to improved oxidation rate by TiO2 nanoparticle, however punished with little NOx. The study led to the decision that adding 150 ppm of TiO2 with WPO would be the decent substitute for diesel for the engines that are operated under 25\u00b0BTDC.", "qas": [{"id": "17017", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "plastics", "answer_start": 26}, {"text": "improper waste management", "answer_start": 39}, {"text": "plastic leftovers", "answer_start": 88}, {"text": "waste", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "waste plastic food containers", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "waste plastic oil (WPO", "answer_start": 329}]}]}, {"context": "Background The demand for more sustainable packaging materials is increasing. However, the multidisciplinary and complexity of this topic often lead to misconceptions among food packaging designers and producers, which challenge the creation of more sustainable food packaging systems. Scope and approach This manuscript presents in a holistic perspective the most relevant parameters that need to be considered for sustainability in food packaging and aims to increase the awareness of food and packaging producers to create effective sustainable packaging materials for foods. Key Findings and Conclusions The use of bio-based plastic packaging materials contribute to create more sustainable food packaging materials, comparatively to conventional plastic packaging materials, when looking at climate impact responses. Although bio-based plastic packaging materials have reduced climate impact, there are other environmental impacts (e.g. eutrophication, use of water and pesticides, effects on biodiversity) that are less favorable for using bio-based materials and should also be considered. Recycling of the packaging significantly contributes to reduce its environmental and climate impacts. The sum of the climate and environmental impacts of the packaging should be seen together with the food it protects. The combined system should be assessed in its entire lifecycle and optimized through the design, production and end of life of the packaging material to improve its sustainability.", "qas": [{"id": "17018", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "bio-based plastic packaging materials", "answer_start": 619}, {"text": "conventional plastic packaging materials", "answer_start": 738}]}]}, {"context": "Pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and municipal plastic waste (MPW) have been investigated in batch reactor at 500, 550 and 600\u00b0C both in absence and presence of catalysts (Y-zeolite, \u03b2-zeolite, equilibrium FCC, MoO3, Ni\u2013Mo-catalyst, HZSM-5 and Al(OH)3).

PHA production by pure microbial cultures has been developed and assessed in several LCAs during the previous decade. Recent developments within mixed-culture PHA production call for environmental assessment to guide in technology development. Mixed-culture PHA production can use the organic content in wastewater as a feedstock; the production may then be integrated with wastewater treatment (WWT) processes. This means that mixed-culture PHA is produced as a by-product from services in the WWT.

Environmental impacts of processes producing multiple products or services need to be allocated between the different products or services. Such situations occur both in feedstock production and when the studied system is providing multiple functions. The selection of allocation method is shown to determine the LCA results.

Probabilistic material flow analysis (PMFA) was used to quantify flows from production in 45 product categories to their end-of-life in Europe and Switzerland. We then considered 40 release pathways for macro- and microplastic flows to assess polymer release into Switzerland's environment.

Further, Indian coals possess high ash content (20\u201340%) and hence they produce a low calorific value gas on gasification.

High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives.

The review revealed that plastic waste is not biodegraded and can only be broken down, predominantly by physical processes, into small particles of micron to nanometre size. Particles (<150 \u03bcm) can be ingested by living organisms, migrate through the intestinal wall and reach lymph nodes and other body organs.

As a consequence, plastic pollution has become one of the most prolific fields of research in research areas including chemistry, physics, oceanography, biology, ecology, ecotoxicology, molecular biology, sociology, economy, conservation, management, and even politics. In this context, one may legitimately expect plastic pollution research to be highly interdisciplinary. However, using the emerging topic of microplastic and nanoplastic leachate (i.e., the desorption of molecules that are adsorbed onto the surface of a polymer and/or absorbed into the polymer matrix in the absence of plastic ingestion) in the ocean as a case study, we argue that this is still far from being the case. Instead, we highlight that plastic pollution research rather seems to remain structured in mostly isolated monodisciplinary studies. A plethora of analytical methods are now available to qualify and quantify plastic monomers, polymers and the related additives. We nevertheless show though a survey of the literature that most studies addressing the effects of leachates on marine organisms essentially still lack of a quantitative assessment of the chemical nature and content of both plastic items and their leachates. In the context of the ever-increasing research effort devoted to assess the biological and ecological effects of plastic waste, we subsequently argue that the lack of a true interdisciplinary approach is likely to hamper the development of this research field.

Accordingly, the present paper provides a critical insight into the physico-chemical properties, sources, distributions, behaviour and toxicity of paint particles in the marine environment. Paint particles contain a greater proportion of additives than plastics and, consequently, are more brittle, angular, opaque, dense, heterogeneous and layered than microplastics of equivalent dimensions.

Estimates of paint particle emissions to the marine environment vary widely, with calculated contributions to the total synthetic micro-debris input as high as 35%. Upper estimates are consistent with available (albeit limited) quantitative information on the relative abundance of paint particles amongst synthetic material captured by sea surface trawls and ingested by marine animals. Of greatest environmental concern is the high chemical toxicity of paint particles compared with similarly-sized microplastics and other synthetic debris.

This study is novel as it introduces the global performance of different green roof configurations, including: common material frequently used in green roof applications (1), recycled or reused material (2), and proposals for novel materials (3) for which there was no evidence of recurrent use in this field. For this purpose, a multi-criteria decision analysis is developed considering several key indicators selected under sustainability criteria. To carry out this analysis, the indicators were experimentally quantified through laboratory tests, while the importance given to each indicator was evaluated through bibliographic references and consultation with experts in the sector. Results showed that the substrate including reused or recycled material (S2) generally provides better performance, and highlighted the suitability of combinations with both woven polypropylene geotextile (G1) and non-woven geotextile made using recycled polypropylene (G2).", "qas": [{"id": "17316", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "recycled polypropylene", "answer_start": 1391}]}]}, {"context": "               This chapter provides a general review of the management of wastewater produced due to petroleum products.

Results revealed that leachates from PET, LDPE, PS and PP contained fibres in addition to other particles. Results showed that PC (19868 items/L) has the largest, while PET (4099 items/L) has the smallest number of microplastic particles per litre.

Melon plants grown in a mixture which included compost produced using vine pruning waste had a greater shoot weight than those grown on peat alone, while the mixture including compost derived from pepper pruning waste gave a shoot weight similar to that of peat-grown plants. Furthermore, the composts elaborated using vine shoot prunings had added value with respect to their use as growing media components for seedling production of melon, due to their suppression of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis.

In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness & capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution.

The results obtained in the present work indicated that 1%-Zn modified HZSM-5 produced a more relative proportion of aromatics (25.12%) in the co-pyrolysis oil organic phase, followed by 5% Ni and 5%-Zn-loaded HZSM-5 at 16.22% and 15.76% respectively. Furthermore, 5% Ni-HZSM-5 has shown higher deoxygenation ability (58.43%) in reducing the oxygenates formed, followed by 5% Mn (40.96%) and 1% Zn (35.37%) respectively. While, 5% Mn-HZSM-5 generated pyrolytic gases with higher volumetric compositions of (C2-C4) light olefins at 15.84%, followed by 1% Mn (13.97%) and 10% Ni (13.61%) respectively and these volumetric yields were strongly correlated with intermediate acidity of catalysts. The physical properties (e.g. HHV ~ 41\u201343 MJ/kg) of the resultant organic fraction of catalytic co-pyrolysis bio-oil are almost analogous to conventional fuels such as diesel and light fuel oil (LFO).

The results of a previous end-of-life impact assessment showed that use of SR as a fuel supplement for cement manufacturing was environmentally beneficial to the current practice of landfilling and appears better in comparison to the other management methods studied. However, because many reuse and recycling options may not be cost effective, there is a need for further study. Simplistic methods to separate SR into energy and mineral rich streams may facilitate the use of a sizable fraction of SR. Due to the large scale of the cement industry in the US, a significant amount of SR is recoverable. The goal of this study was to identify the feedstock quality parameters needed to satisfy kiln operators and then to assess the mechanical means necessary to process SR into material acceptable as coal and mineral substitutes. Field tests were conducted to separate and beneficiate the coarse SR waste stream. Density separation techniques commonly used by shredders in the past were tested to separate rubber and plastics from non-combustibles and contaminants (e.g., PVC and copper wire). A fraction constituting about 30wt% of the total SR had fuel characteristics mirroring those of coal. However, remaining levels of potentially problematic constituents (e.g., total chlorine and heavy metals) may limit use to a low relative addition rate at some kilns. An economic review of a full-scale separation system showed that processing SR appears to be economically marginal considering avoided landfilling costs alone.

Herein, considering the fascinating absorption selectivity of superwetting materials, a robust magnetic-responsive superhydrophobic and superoleophilic sponge was firstly used to quickly eliminate MPs from water with very high efficiency. The functional sponge was fabricated by a non-fluorinated coating technique that consisted of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) grafted Fe3O4 particle, PDMS grafted halloysite nanotubes, and PDMS binder. The coated sponge achieved excellent mechanically durable and chemically stable superhydrophobicity that resisted a series of severe treatments. It was unquestionable to show very fast oil absorption. What's more, it especially showed very high adsorption capacity (24.3\u201348.2 mg/g) and could quickly adsorb almost 100% MPs (polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene) from aqueous suspensions. Moreover, the removal rates remained almost 100% for these MPs after 50 cycles. Besides, the coated sponge had excellent salt tolerance and antibacterial activity to Escherichia coli (E. coli) (99.91%) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (90.46%). The adsorption mechanism of the coating was discussed from the perspectives of molecular structure, electronic effect, steric hindrance, and size-scale effect. The absorption driving force mainly derived from the intra-particle diffusion under capillary attraction, whilst slight electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond interaction, and \u03c3-p (or p-p) conjugation between PDMS and MPs.

The use of ice as formwork resolves several systematic problems related to sustainability which are associated with the production of free-form prefabricated concrete elements, including the issue of material waste produced with existing models of fabrication. On the one hand, automation of formwork production by means of CNC machinery allows for the production of complex and precise geometries; on the other hand, as ice naturally melts away once the concrete has structurally set, the manual labor involved in the whole cycle of production is reduced dramatically. The Ice Formwork system is based on the utilization of a frost-resistant design of high-performance concrete (HPCfr). Numerous tests have proven that the Ice Formwork method of casting provides a high quality geometric transfer from ice to concrete, ensuring that no deformation of formwork occurs during the casting process. A key question is whether the trade-off in energy spent on refrigeration to maintain subfreezing temperature throughout the process of fabrication will negate Ice Formwork's validity as an alternative to traditional concrete formwork.

This study tackled the ecodesign of a clam shell for packaging applications based on a novel ML film made of PLA and thermoplastic starch (TPS), evaluating the environmental performance of different design concepts through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In order to assure proper compatibility between PLA and TPS, the use of dielectric barrier discharge (dbd) plasma technology at atmospheric pressure to increase the hydrophilicity of PLA was investigated.

Despite the contribution of the PLA end-of-life phase to the overall environmental impact of the ML clam shell is low, the methodological approach to end-of-life can have a significant influence on the LCA results. This seems to be due to the low PLA recycling and recovery rate assumed, which is nevertheless realistic. The promotion of high recovery and recycling rates should therefore be a priority in the future. At the current development stage, even the most improved ML clam shell concept obtained using atmospheric plasma technology is not an environmentally sound alternative to pure PLA clam shell, although it is likely to be a cost-effective option.

Eighty years later, with pioneering advances and series of breakthroughs in research and industrial innovations, plastics have become an integral part of our everyday lives. While the applications of plastics are multifarious, their unrestricted disposal is causing damage to the ecosystem services and biodiversity. Furthermore, the plastic economy entirely relies on non-renewable, climate-changing petrochemical resources. A circular economy (CE), which aims to retain plastics at their highest value for a longest period of time in the system is one of the strategies to overcome these challenges. The present article discusses about strategies that can be employed to incorporate circularity and concepts of CE in plastics production systems. It emphasizes that although CE aims at design out waste, it needs to go a step ahead and also consider the impact of raw materials, the entire product value chain and end-of life options to achieve sustainability. It captures the emerging area of biodegradable low carbon polymers from renewable resources with an emphasis on technical and environmental advantages that contribute to the reduction in carbon footprints. Research carried out from a sustainability standpoint by considering CO2 emissions right from production stage to end-of-life that helps in achieving a low carbon economy is reviewed. Some challenges that need to be addressed for future work, the potential role of sustainability analysis in enhancing the use of biopolymers are summarized.

Mean abundances of MPs in water and sediment were 202 \u00b1 100 items/m3 and 58 \u00b1 27 items/kg, dry weight, respectively. The upstream tributary, Pum Qu in China, had the smallest abundance of MPs, while the middle tributary, Sun Koshi in Nepal, had the greatest abundance. Compared to international values in rivers, contamination of the KR with MPs was low to moderate. Fibers represented 98% of all MP particles observed, which consisted of polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyamide, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Blue and black MPs were prevalent, and small MPs (<1 mm) accounted for approximately 60% of all MPs. Atmospheric transmission and deposition were considered to be the principal sources of MPs in the upstream tributary. The results imply that point sources associated with mostly untreated sewage effluents and solid wastes from households, major settlements, towns, and cities were most important sources of MPs in the KR. Non-point sources from agricultural runoff and atmospheric transport and deposition in the middle stream tributaries also contribute a part of microplastics, while the least amount was from fishing in the downstream tributary. Urbanization, agriculture, traffic, and tourism contributed to pollution in the KR by MPs.

The composites are intended to be used in building walls. They are mainly cement-stabilized red clays (CSRC) with incorporation of different kind of natural and industrial insulators. Red clay is presented as material with high thermal performance. Natural wastes are of great importance owing to their low-cost and environment-friendly nature. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity measurements are carried out using Hot Disk thermal analyzer. Combined with the density data, thermal capacity is calculated. The results of the investigation show that the thermal performance of a building material can be improved by using red clay as basic material instead of sand, and incorporating thermal insulators. The thermal conductivity of cement-stabilized sand (0.934\u202fW/m\u202fK) is greater than cement-stabilized clay (0.591\u202fW/m\u202fK), which becomes lower when incorporating polystyrene (0.591\u202fW/m\u202fK).

The development of the model involves the following steps: the selection of sustainability criteria, the aggregation of criteria using multi-criteria decision making, the formulation of the SPF calculation, and the generation of a web-based interface for packers and product importers to calculate the differential fee applying to their own packaging. The aspects of sustainability considered are environmental aspects resulting mostly from life cycle assessment (e.g., global warming and human toxicity), and social aspects related to environmental information present in/on the packaging (e.g., the recycling bin symbol and carbon footprint information).

Rapid increase in the population has led to increased food production thus increasing the impacts. Food production involves considerable energy inputs and resource inputs. Besides this, there is also a lot of food wastage as it moves through the supply chain that includes the manufacturing stages also. Thus it is necessary that as we increase the food production we should also make efforts to make the food production supply chains sustainable. Efforts should be made to optimize the energy and resource usage during the food production processes. Waste reduction is also very important. The present study selects a food product i.e. Kheer. It is a very popular milk based food item in the Indian cuisine. Besides milk the other main ingredients are rice and sugar. The commercial production of Kheer involves a considerable amount of energy usage, besides the use of packaging material as well as for its supply to the customers. An approach based on LCA and the energy, resource and waste (ERW) impacts has been developed to evaluate the sustainability of manufacturing processes. First of all, Life cycle assessment of the production process involved in the commercial production of kheer is carried out to assess their environmental impacts.

Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to evaluate the potential of nanomaterial Fe2O3-modified graphene oxide (FGO, 50\u2013250 mg L\u22121) to eliminate the adverse effects of nanoplastics in plants. Wheat plants exposed to polystyrene nanoplastics concentrations (PS, 10, 50 and 100 mg L\u22121) showed decreased growth, water content and loss of photosynthetic efficiency. PS toxicity negatively altered gas exchange, antenna structure and electron transport in photosystems. Although the antioxidant system was partially activated (only superoxide dismutase (SOD), NADPH oxidase (NOX) and glutathione reductase (GR)) in plants treated with PS, it failed to prevent PS-triggered oxidative damage, as showing lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels. FGOs eliminated the adverse impacts of PS pollution on growth, water status, gas exchange and oxidative stress markers. In addition, FGOs preserve the biochemical reactions of photosynthesis by actively increasing chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in the stressed-wheat leaves. The activities of all enzymatic antioxidants increased, and the H2O2 and TBARS contents decreased. GSH-mediated detoxifying antioxidants such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were stimulated by FGOs against PS pollution. FGOs also triggered the enzymes and non-enzymes related to the Asada-Halliwell cycle and protected the regeneration of ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH).

Sound intensities and corresponding frequencies are measured for porous materials with desired vacuum levels. The vacuum in porous materials, even at relatively low vacuum levels, has a significant effect on sound reduction. A vacuum of 10% in glass ball and polystyrene foam can lead to a noise reduction of more than 3 dB.

The aim of this paper is to review packaging films with oxygen barrier properties similar to those of the conventional films but also having biodegradable properties. From the literature, the oxygen permeability coefficient improved with the high strength, modulus, and ductility, as the nanocellulose was reinforcing with biopolymer. This might be due to nanocellulose that contributes to the higher stretchability of the composite biofilms. A fine dispersion of nanocellulose throughout the polymer host promoted several improved properties of the composite biofilms.

Among them, temperature gradient and heating rate are largely known as influencing parameters. As lower temperature favors the formation of aliphatic compounds whereas higher temperature is associated with the production of complex aromatic compounds.

The increase of water salinity from 0 to 25 mmol/L (NaCl) decreased the maximal outlet MPs concentration by 50.5\u201368.4% for different sized MPs. Since chemical aging would lead to the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups and make MPs more negatively charged, it greatly increased the maximal outlet MPs concentration by 0.53\u20135.67 times. Compared with the traditional attachment model (AM), the attachment-detachment model (ADM) could better simulate the gradual desorption of large MPs from soil in the process of clean water flushing, indicating the nonnegligible detachment of large MPs from soil. In ADM, the desorption coefficient gradually decreased in the process of clean water flushing, which was only 31.6% of the initial value after flushing kept for 10 PV. Moreover, the equations to calculate the adsorption and desorption coefficients of MPs in the saturated zone were developed, which considered both MPs and aquifer characteristics.

Using data from a plastics manufacturer, a cradle-to-grave study was conducted for trays produced from recycled polyethylene terephthalate, calculating their product carbon footprint and analysing how various parameters affect the carbon footprint. A model based on a spreadsheet analysis was developed, which allows the product carbon footprint to be determined using production batch data. It was found that the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of 1 kg of recycled polyethylene terephthalate trays containing 85% recycled content was 1.538 kg CO2e. The raw material, manufacturing, secondary packaging, transport and end-of-life stages each contributed 45%, 38%, 5%, 3% and 9% of the total life cycle greenhouse gases respectively. The recycled content of raw material was found to have a significant effect on product carbon footprint: a 24% decrease in tray carbon footprint could be obtained by manufacturing trays from 100% recycled content, compared to the current recycled content level of 85%. A reduction in tray weight was found to give almost an equivalent proportionate reduction in carbon footprint, with 20% and 30% tray weight reductions resulting in product carbon footprint reductions of 18.7% and 28% respectively. Transport was found to only contribute a minor amount of the greenhouse gases (3%) and hence improving transport efficiency had very little effect on the carbon footprint. The effect of end-of-life treatment was also found to be relatively small. The worst case scenario of no recycling taking place in the end-of-life stage results in the carbon footprint of the trays increasing by 2.7%, while increasing the recycling rate from 23.7% to 32% and 50%, results in the carbon footprint decreasing by 1% and 3% respectively. In both the extrusion and thermoforming processes, the specific manufacturing carbon footprints arising from consumption of electricity, chilled water energy and compressed air were found to decrease logarithmically with production speed.

The plastic samples caused oxidative stress (85%), baseline toxicity (42%), antiestrogenicity (40%) and antiandrogenicity (27%). Positive findings were measured after UV-C (63%) and UV-A/Baq (50%) treatments, followed by UV-A/B (48%) and DC (33%). Overall, we detected between 42 (DC) and 2896 (UV-A/Baq) chemical compounds.

UV exacerbates the plastics\u2019 toxicity by either generating active compounds and/or by facilitating their release.

As much as 98% of copper and 82% of nickel were leached by indirect bioleaching under optimum conditions. The better performance in the presence of biochar is due to both galvanic interactions between biochar and solid waste. The biochemical characterization of bioleaching solution suggested that the high concentration of biochar (> 1.6 g/L) led to copper absorption by functional groups on the surface of biochar.

Simultaneously, a material flows analysis in different media of the marine environment is carried out using system dynamics. A preliminary model of plastics mobilization into the ocean to other media of the marine environment (like sediments and biota) is developed and validated with the existing data from the previous steps of the work. This work expands the current knowledge on the plastics management, their transformations and accumulation in the marine environment and the harmful effects on it. Likewise, preliminary dynamic model of mobilization of plastics in the ocean is implemented, run, and validated. The developed model can be used to predict trends in the distribution of the plastics in the ocean with time. In addition, the most important reservoirs of plastics in the ocean can be observed.

The regression model is a further generalised regression model for estimating compressive strength from UPV of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) that can be adapted to different testing systems. The BPNN model, optimised by a genetic algorithm, is also employed for more accurate predictions compared to the regression model.

Because polylactide polymers are known to be compostable the question is often raised about the behaviour of these materials in landfills. In order to study the behaviour of Ingeo polylactides (PLA) in landfills two studies were performed aimed at generating reliable information on the anaerobic biodegradation of PLA under conditions of extended time and modest temperatures. The first test (under accelerated landfill conditions) was done at 21 \u00b0C, and three moisture levels, extending to 390 days and the second test (a high solids anaerobic digestion test under optimal and significantly accelerated conditions) was conducted at 35 \u00b0C for 170 days. Each test is meant to represent an accelerated test of what could happen under anaerobic landfill conditions. These two tests each had accelerated the biological degradation sufficiently that they were in some sense equivalent to approximately a century of a \u201ctypical\u201d biologically active landfill. The semicrystalline polylactide samples did not produce a statistically significant quantity of biogas during either test. The amorphous PLA did generate a small amount of biogas in the test at 35 \u00b0C, but none in the test at ambient temperature. Here it should be noted that the tests were conducted under accelerated, optimal landfill conditions, the biodegradation was observed in a 100 year timeframe and the market volume of amorphous PLA is low. We conclude that semicrystalline PLA (typical of >96 wt% of resin used to manufacture products), under anaerobic biological conditions typical of a landfill at moderate temperatures (where PLA hydrolysis is slow), will not lead to significant generation of methane, and that no significant population of organisms is available under anaerobic conditions to directly degrade high molecular weight PLA. Because there was no direct biological degradation of PLA under the anaerobic conditions, it is likely that any degradation of PLA in a landfill would require a chemical hydrolysis step prior to any biodegradation, which is analogous to the situation in aerobic composting. At 20 \u00b0C this process is estimated to take 100+ years, and under those conditions the degradation of the PLA would be extremely low.

However, original equipment manufacturers currently face several issues for the implementation of design for disassembly. To overcome these issues, first of all an in-depth analysis of design-for-disassembly opportunities and challenges is presented. Taking into account the results of this analysis, innovative low-cost elastomer-based fasteners have been developed, which can be simultaneously released by applying a sufficiently high force over a period of time.

The saccharification by immobilized enzymes and the fermentation by immobilized yeast cells were conducted in two separate vessels connected by a pump. During the experiments, glucose concentrations were always maintained at low levels which potentially reduce product inhibition effects on the enzymes. Covalent immobilization of enzymes and yeast cells on the plasma treated polymer reduces loss by shear flow induced detachment. The potential for continuous flow production of ethanol and the influence of daughter yeast cells in the circulating flow on the immobilized enzyme activity are discussed.", "qas": [{"id": "17741", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "polystyrene surfaces", "answer_start": 547}, {"text": "polymer", "answer_start": 998}]}]}, {"context": "               Nanomaterials nowadays have been receiving more attention from scientists and researchers in different areas of environmental science, specifically in bioremediation due to their unique physical and chemical properties. For some types of waste, bioremediation provides a good cleanup strategy but as expected, it will not be useful for all. At sites with high concentrations of chemicals that are toxic to most microorganisms, bioremediation may not provide a feasible strategy. These include heavy metals and salt. Further, the advancement in science and technology has increased the standard of living which directly or indirectly contributes to the increase in waste and toxic material. Therefore the remediation of contaminants by use of existing technology is not effective and efficient in cleaning up the environment. In such cases, nanomaterials may be applied for bioremediation, which will not only have less toxic effect on microorganisms, but will also improve the microbial activity of the specific waste and toxic material which will be cost effective and not very time consuming.

The recycling of plastic products after their life cycle can obviously contribute a great deal to the reduction of the environmental and economical impacts.

More recently invented technologies based on mid-infrared, Raman spectroscopy or laser-aided spectroscopy are still under development and expected to be rather expensive. A promising approach to put high sorting purities into practice is to label plastic resins with unique combinations of fluorescence markers (tracers). These are incorporated into virgin resins during the manufacturing process at the ppm (or sub ppm) concentration level, just large enough that the fluorescence emissions can be detected with sensitive instrumentation but neither affect the visual appearance nor the mechanical properties of the polymers.

There are two basic methods of cell cultivation\u2014batch and continuous. Batch cultivations are commonly applied in pharmaceutical and food productions. Strict quality control up to the detailed process flow sheet by FDA and the commonly low-production rate are the main reasons for batch operations, among others. The primary form of continuous culture is a steady-state CSTR or chemostat. A chemostat ensures a time-invariant chemical environment for the cell cultivation. The growth rate can be directly manipulated and substrate concentration in the reactor is low, which can promote a desired product formation. The productivity of chemostat increases with increasing dilution rate to a maximum before sharply decreases near the washout limit, which is affected by the endogenous needs and/or death rate. The growth and/or product formation patterns can be different between batch and continuous cultivations\u2014for example, a lag-phase in batch and metabolic overflow (or Crabtree) effect in a continuous system. The use of cell recycle with a CSTR increases volumetric productivity and has found use in large-volume, consistent production demand, and low-product-value processes (e.g., waste treatment and fuel-grade ethanol production), as well as increasingly in high-product-value processes (e.g., pharmaceutical applications using perfusion systems with mammalian cells). Both analytical and graphical methods of solutions have been demonstrated in examples. To mimic the continuous culturing for high-productivity and control while maintaining the certainty of a batch, one can employ fed-batch operations. Continuous culturing and mimicked continuous culturing can avoid the overflow metabolism (formation of side metabolites, such as acetate for Escherichia coli, lactic acid in cell cultures, ethanol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), oxygen limitation (anaerobiosis), often associated with batch culturing.

To develop strategy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of animal-based food supply chains, the common environmental hotspots among different types of food, the role of transport logistics and the consequence of end market need to be better understood. Life cycle assessment was adopted to model three types of animal-based food chains (beef, butter and salmon), with specific technologies, high spatial-resolution logistics and typical consumption patterns for three markets: local, regional (intra-European) and international. The results confirmed that the farm production stage usually had the greatest environmental impact, except when air transport was used for distribution. Potentially, the role of end market also can significantly influence the environmental impacts. To understand more, three improvement options were examined in detail with regard to hotspots for climate change: novel feed ingredients (farm production stage), sustainable aviation fuel (transport and logistics stage) and reduction of wasted food (consumption and end of life stage). Significant reduction was achieved in the salmon system by sustainable aviation fuel (64%) and novel feed (15%). Minimizing food waste drove the greatest reduction in the beef supply chain (23%) and the international butter supply chain can reduce 50% of GHG mission by adopting sustainable aviation fuel. Combined interventions could reduce GHG emission of animal-based food supply chains by 15% to 82%, depending on market, transport and food waste behaviour.

The increasing expansion of the chemical industry has led to the evolution of traditional chemical compounds into the environment. The use of this method reduces excessive sludge and, in addition to reducing environmental hazards, reduces the cost of waste management. Today, the production of sewage containing toxic and complex compounds has limited the use of conventional wastewater treatment processes. On the other hand, environmental standards have become more stringent in the world over the past two decades. One of the newest technologies of the last 20years in this field is known as AOPs. AOP systems are considered as an efficient and key technology for the world's future since the last years of the 20th century. The wastewater of the textile industry is a complex sewage containing various chemicals and colored wastewater, and their evacuation produces severe environmental problems. The AOP method is a chemical purification method that is used to eliminate problematic organic matter and to degrade and decompose materials that are not readily and completely decomposed by oxidation and conventional biological methods. Refined waste products that require third-party refinement often contain low concentrations of natural and synthetic chemicals that are to be removed or dispersed into simpler materials for the preservation of the environment as well as for general health. The main advantage of the AOP method is its ability to produce high concentrations of radical hydroxyl (                                             HO). As a strong oxidizer, this radical is capable of oxidizing most organic compounds to carbon dioxide, water, and mineral acids.

Kinetic analysis using Coats-Redfern method and comparing between different diffusional reaction models showed that using BP-RHA-T follows a one-dimensional diffusion reaction, similar to the non-catalytic run. Using RHA-T resulted in higher activation energy (83.03 kJ/mol to 84.91 kJ/mol) compared to the non-catalytic run (62.39 kJ/mol to 68.97 kJ/mol). Thermodynamic analysis showed the pyrolysis runs were endothermic and non-spontaneous. Using RHA-T resulted in a higher change of enthalpy, a lower change of Gibbs free energy and a less negative change of entropy.

Research lines focus on environmental remediation, with the detection, removal, and degradation of emerging contaminants. Printed materials serve as molds or supports for the fabrication of microreactional or adsorptive devices, and in the one-step fabrication of devices with photocatalytic or conductive properties. However, the literature reports current challenges in the manufacture of these prototypes, such as the quality of micrometer-scale channels, the need to functionalize the supports, and the complexity in the production process of functional materials in a single step. Among the different techniques, fused deposition modeling (FDM) stands out as the cheapest 3D printing technique, becoming the most popular in these prototypes manufacturing. The main limitation of the FDM process is the manufacture of non-functional parts since the final parts are produced from polymeric filaments such as ABS and PLA. Therefore, the production of functional filaments for 3D printing is an attractive solution to bring functionality to printed parts. This production step is still very challenging, as specific physical properties of the matrix and polymer particles are necessary for printing with adequate performance.

In most modern developments, sewage and runoff are collected into a separate system of sanitary sewers and storm drains to avoid pollution of the water course by the occasional spillage of sewage and storm water mixtures. In the presence of ample oxygen, the rate at which a particular type of effluent is able to satisfy its oxygen demand depends on what it contains.

The structure of Fe3O4 MPs was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results show that nanoparticles have good coating effect of OA and the measured water contact angles after different separation cycles remains at 138\u00b0, which means nanoparticles still have good oleophilic and hydrophobic performances.

Water resource pollution is increasing due to an increasing world population and its corresponding activities. Amongst the different technologies used to decrease pollutant levels in water, adsorption technology is highly effective even at low pollutant concentrations. Carbonaceous materials and their composites have been widely used due to their unique surface properties and high adsorption capacities, but better adsorbents with higher pollutant adsorption capacities and faster uptake are still needed.

The pollutants are consumed by living organisms directly or indirectly reducing animal and economic wellbeing. The degradation of contaminants is imperative owing to the prolonged persistence of contaminants like plastics, heavy metals, pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and hydrocarbons. Remediation of such pollutants requires efficient methods to prevent mobilizing-contaminants leaching into soil and finally to human beings. In this regard, metagenomics (MGs), a non-culturable technique, involving the direct recovery of the genetic material from environmental samples is an effective tool for understanding the remediation process mediated by microorganisms and their gene products like enzymes. MGs offers a gateway to previously hidden microbial communities grown in the normal and extreme environment through sequence-based or function-based approaches. The culture-independent MGs approach in combination with other meta-omics approaches involves an easy and rapid method for the selection of remediation-efficient microbes. This paper elucidates the negative implications of several contaminants on terrestrial and aquatic biota besides highlighting the role of MGs and associated meta-omics approaches in characterizing contaminant degrading microbes. The MGs research related to bioremediation can help to generate information that will improve the bioremediation process and aid in deciphering the complete microbe-mediated bioremediation mechanism pathways. In future MGs can be helpful to comprehensively understand the mechanisms involved in efficient bioremediation, develop new strategies and models for application in rapid, accurate and efficient bioremediation process and optimize the bioremediation technique.

The present study aimed to examine the effect of precursor and lightweight aggregate type on workability, compressive strength, flexural strength as well as the environmental impact of lightweight mortars. For this purpose, precursors derived from waste aluminosilicate sources including ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), metakaolin (MK), waste ceramic powder (WCP), and waste clay brick powder (WCBP) were used for the synthesis of alkali-activated and geopolymer mortars. In addition, an equivalent Portland cement mortar was prepared for comparison purposes. Pumice and lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) were used as the lightweight aggregates. Based on the test results, the WCP- and WCBP-based geopolymer mortars exhibited a higher workability than other mortar mixes. Generally, mortars prepared with pumice aggregate showed lower workability and higher mechanical strength than LECA incorporated mixes due to the higher density of pumice and its better bonding with paste. Alkali-activated and geopolymer mortars presented a higher initial strength and reached about 80% of their 28-day compressive strength in 1 day, whereas that of the cement mortar was only 33%.

In comparison, more precise measurements for RPF were conducted in Calvet calorimeters (C 80 and MS 80), in which heating rates were 0.1 and 0.02\u00b0C/min, respectively.

Results showed that measurement conditions, such as heating rate, sample size, sensitivity of calorimetry, and adiabatic condition in storage significantly affect the thermal behaviors of RPF. The TG\u2013DTA curves showed that the visible weight loss and exothermic reaction of RPF occurred at a temperature above 170\u00b0C. This is caused by the oxidation and degradation of the components in the RPF. Ignition of RPF by self-heating was found at the corresponding temperature in the wire mesh cube.

Thus, the present review addresses the genotoxic potential of these emerging contaminants in aquatic organisms and in human peripheral lymphocytes and identified the research gaps in this area. Several genotoxic endpoints were implicated, including the frequency of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), nuclear buds (NBUD), DNA strand breaks, and the percentage of DNA in the tail (%Tail DNA).

Potential use of algal biomass includes nutrients recovery, heavy metals removal, COD, BOD, coliforms, and other disease-causing pathogens reduction and production of bioenergy and valuable products.

These indices were paired with traditional indices to compare the effect of accounting methodology and waste source on digester sustainability.

However, as the plots at the border of the field had up to 18 times higher MP loads than the inner plots of the trial, we suggest that littering also contributed significantly to MP pollution.

There are two basic methods of cell cultivation: batch and continuous. Batch cultivations are commonly applied in pharmaceutical and food productions. Strict quality control up to the detailed process flow sheet by FDA, and the commonly low production rate are the main reasons for batch operations, among others. The primary form of continuous culture is a steady state continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) or chemostat. A chemostat ensures a time-invariant chemical environment for the cell cultivation. The growth rate can be directly manipulated and substrate concentration in the reactor is low, which can promote a desired product formation. The productivity of chemostat increases with increasing dilution rate to a maximum before sharply decreasing near the washout limit, which is affected by the endogenous needs and/or death rate. The growth and/or product formation patterns can be different between batch and continuous cultivations; for example, a lag-phase in batch and metabolic overflow (or Crabtree) effect in a continuous system. The use of cell recycle with a CSTR increases volumetric productivity and has found use in large-volume, consistent production demand and low-product-value processes (eg, waste treatment and fuel-grade ethanol production), as well as increased use in high-product-value processes (eg, pharmaceutical applications using perfusion systems with mammalian cells). Both analytical and graphical methods of solutions have been demonstrated in examples. To mimic the continuous culturing for high productivity and control while maintaining the certainty of a batch, one can employ fed-batch operations. Continuous culturing and mimicked continuous culturing can avoid the overflow metabolism (formation of side metabolites, such as acetate for Escherichia coli, lactic acid in cell cultures, ethanol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and oxygen limitation (anaerobiosis), which is often associated with batch culturing.

The waste fractions suitable for RDF have a high calorific value and are often not suitable for material recycling. With current treatment processes, RDF still contains components which impede the utilization in firing systems or limit the degree of substitution.

The RDF-particles experience a centrifugal force which fluidized the bed radially. The technical principle allows tearing up of particle clusters to single particles.

We conclude that MPs can alter a range of key soil biogeochemical processes by changing its properties, forming specific microbial hotspots, resulting in multiple effects on microbial activities and functions. Mixed effects of MPs on plant growth and performance can be explained by the direct toxicity of MPs or the indirect alteration in soil physical structures and microbial communities (i.e. symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). Because of the diverse nature of MPs found in soils, in terms of polymer type, shape and size, we also see differing effects on soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, nutrient cycling, and greenhouse gases production. Importantly, increased bioavailable C from the decomposition of biodegradable MPs, which enhances microbial and enzymatic activities, potentially accelerates SOM mineralization and increases nutrient competition between plant and microbes.

Bioplastics, for example, are considered both a potential solution as well as a new source of harmful environmental impacts, mainly arising from their use of agricultural biomass. Yet, bioeconomy monitoring systems do not currently capture such net effects of substitution at the sub-sectoral level. This paper explores how such monitoring could be enhanced to support sustainable transition by analysing plastics substitution and related economic and environmental effects using an extended input-output model that includes environmental data and disaggregates the plastics and bioplastics sectors. The ongoing transition in the German plastics sector \u2013 measured by combining information from expert interviews with secondary sources \u2013 is characterized by low domestic demand, high dependence on imported inputs, and relatively low fossil-resource savings. Results for selected indicators reveal few trade-offs regarding fossil resource use, water use, value added, and employer compensation. Process greenhouse gas emissions are significantly higher when substituting bioplastics for plastics, if credits for bio-based carbon are neglected. This study proposes that sustainable transition in the German plastics sector would benefit from more specific monitoring and clearly justified policy targets, based upon reconsideration of stated objectives in bioeconomy strategies. Methodological recommendations include accounting for carbon cycles in greenhouse gas emissions modelling, using further indicators related to possibly harmful impacts on the environment, and distinguishing between domestic and foreign effects by applying the proposed input-output model to the most relevant countries in bioplastics value chains.", "qas": [{"id": "18337", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "Bioplastics", "answer_start": 164}, {"text": "plastics substitution", "answer_start": 569}, {"text": "plastics bioplastics sectors", "answer_start": 1888}, {"text": "German plastics sector", "answer_start": 794}, {"text": "bioplastics", "answer_start": 743}, {"text": "plastics", "answer_start": 167}, {"text": "bioplastics value chains", "answer_start": 1863}]}]}, {"context": "River sand is ruling construction industry due to its tremendous properties and composition.

This article reviewed the recent development of plastic materials that have close contact with food, to wrap and to preserve the food.

The plastics in food packaging have been enhanced with more functions to meet the increasing customer expectations, contributing towards sustainable development and circular economy. This article will focus on the advances in plastics packaging, in the areas of smart and biodegradable food packaging. Smart packaging can be classified into active and intelligent packaging. Active packaging refers to the incorporation of active compounds into the packaging system to extend the product shelf-life, whereas the intelligent packaging involves the use of technology to monitor the food quality and safety.

The diverse reflectance spectra caused by chemically varying polymer types and their different kinds of brightness and transparencies, which are, moreover, influenced further by the respective surface backgrounds. This paper investigates the capability of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data, characterized by a high spatial resolution and equipped with eight distinct and relatively narrow SWIR bands suitable for global monitoring of different types of plastic materials. To meet the objective, hyperspectral measurements and simulations were conducted in the laboratory and by aircraft campaigns, based on the JPL-ECOSTRESS, USGS, and inhouse hyperspectral libraries, all of which are convolved to the spectral response functions of the WV-3 system. Experiments further supported the analyses wherein different plastic materials were placed on different backgrounds, and scaled percentages of plastics per pixel were modeled to determine the minimum detectable fractions. To determine the detectability of plastics with various chemical and physical properties and different fractions against diverse backgrounds, a knowledge-based classifier was developed, the routines of which are based on diagnostic spectral features in the SWIR range. The classifier shows outstanding results on various background scenarios for lab experimental imagery as well as for airborne data and it is further able to mask non-plastic materials. Three clusters of plastic materials can clearly be identified, based on spectra and imagery: The first cluster identifies aliphatic compounds, comprising polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAC), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene (POM), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyamide (PA). The second and third clusters are diagnostic for aromatic hydrocarbons, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), respectively separated from polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyurethane (PU). The robustness of the classifier is examined on the basis of simulated spectra derived from our HySimCaR model, which has been developed in-house. The model simulates radiation transfer by using virtual 3D scenarios and ray tracing, hence, enables the analysis of the influence of various factors, such as material brightness, transparency, and fractional coverage as well as different background materials. We validated our results by laboratory and simulated datasets and by tests using airborne data recorded at four distinct sites with different surface characteristics. The results of the classifier were further compared to results produced by another signature-based method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a commonly used technique, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Finally, we applied and successfully tested the classifier on WV-3 imagery of sites known for a high abundance of plastics in Almeria (Spain), Cairo (Egypt), and Accra, (Ghana, West Africa). Both airborne and WV-3 data were atmospherically corrected and transferred to \u201cat-surface reflectances\u201d.

The modification of PLA with PGA can be achieved via co-polymerization, physical blending and multilayer lamination. PGA and its combination with PLA have been widely studied in bio-medical applications, but not been well developed at large scales due to its relatively high production cost. In this case, the development of novel production technology and the advent of government regulations are the key drivers for the global transition towards bioplastics.

However, in Europe environmental regulations, including the EU Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC and ELV (End of Life Vehicle) Directive 2000/53/EC, have dramatically increased the pressure on all stakeholders to develop alternative solutions. As increasingly stringent legislation forces Shredder Residues (SR) to be diverted from landfilling, newly developed technologies will be in a position to compete for the market value of disposing of the waste. However, the fluff waste stream is so variable that it cannot be automatically assumed that processes developed for one type of fluff will prove to be suitable for other fluff streams. This situation has contributed towards convincing stakeholders to withhold investment funds or delay taking decisions as to how best to proceed; as a consequence, very few technologies have been fully developed on a commercial basis. It is of particular interest therefore that commercial alternatives to be used in dealing with this complex waste stream should be identified. The present paper illustrates the findings of a full-scale thermal treatment performed on SR samples obtained from various shredding plants. The outcome of the study provides an important contribution towards assessing the feasibility and reliability of the process, thus constituting a basic prerequisite for process performance evaluation. The full-scale plant, designed for the thermo-valorization of tyres, was purpose-modified to allow for fluff combustion. Three different fluff compositions (car fluff with different percentage of shredding, whites and 100% car fluff) were taken into consideration. Both the raw samples and solid products were thoroughly characterized. Combustion emissions were continuously analyzed during the test period, alternatively operating for tyre and fluff combustion. Classification of combustion residues for landfill disposal was carried out indicating only 2% (ashes) as hazardous waste. Preliminary results, obtained from a unsophisticated thermodynamic analysis of the process, indicated a value of 0.61 for energy efficiency parameter calculated in accordance with the Directive 2008/98/EC.

The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fate and control of MPs in the open water environment. This review critically discusses the characteristics and pathways of road dust-associated MPs in stormwater and common stormwater treatment processes used for removing MPs, and provides insight into the technical challenges of these technologies.

This is because of the low density of MP particles as well as the low retention time of the wetland. Thus, untreated stormwater, rich in MPs, is released into open waterbodies.

It is the first review, in which both petroleum-derived plastics and bioplastics were analysed regarding their potential impacts on the soil compartment. Petroleum-derived plastics were more frequently studied than bioplastics and among analysed papers about 18% concern bioplastics. It was found that (bio)plastics did not affect the germination of seeds. However, they might contribute to the delay in germination processes. Both inhibitory and stimulating effects were observed in relation to the growth of roots and stems.

These plastics degrade into microplastics (MPs), which along with microbeads and MPs from other sources such as wastewater treatment plants continue to threaten the aquatic system. At such small sizes, and corresponding larger surface areas per unit mass/volume, MPs exhibit enhanced capacity for absorbing and desorbing toxic chemicals/additives. Therefore, MPs can serve as vectors through which additives as well as other persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic chemicals can enter the food chain. Additives are a significant component of most plastic products with some identified as hazardous to health and the environment. One group of additives that has continued to attract interest is organophosphate esters (OPEs), which are used both as flame retardants and plasticizers. Some of these OPEs are suspected carcinogens and endocrine disruptors and have been reported to exert serious toxic effects on freshwater biota. Separate studies on the presence and fate in the freshwater environment of these additives and MPs have emerged recently. However, no studies exist that examine the extent to which plastics additives such as OPEs in sediments are sorbed to MPs as opposed to the sediment itself. This has potentially important implications for the bioavailability of such additives and studies to examine this are recommended. This paper reviews critically the current state-of-knowledge on MPs in freshwater sediments, methods for their analysis, as well as their occurrence, temporal trends, and risks to the freshwater aquatic environment. Moreover, to facilitate the study of additives associated with MPs that have been extracted from sediments, we consider the possible effect of MP isolation methods on the determination of concentrations of associated additives like OPEs.", "qas": [{"id": "18479", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "plastics", "answer_start": 53}, {"text": "These plastics", "answer_start": 95}, {"text": "microplastics", "answer_start": 123}, {"text": "wastewater treatment plants", "answer_start": 207}, {"text": "plastic products", "answer_start": 642}, {"text": "plasticizers", "answer_start": 864}, {"text": "plastics additives", "answer_start": 1204}]}]}, {"context": "The limited energy resources in the world require maximum attention in energy saving and energy use.

However, the damage they cause to the environment in their production is great, therefore insomuch that the manufacture and use of some insulation materials are prohibited.

A new insulation board was produced by adding boron to sheep wool, and this new insulation board was compared with rock wool and expanded polystyrene (EPS), which are widely used today. To carry out the experimental studies, an experiment building with full size and 3 rooms had been built. First, the building was completely covered with rock wool and the effect of the facades on the temperature and moisture in the environment was observed. Afterwards, as one room was covered with EPS and the other room was covered by the boron doped sheep wool insulation material, the insulation materials were compared wtih one another. In the experimental studies that was carried out, while rock wool gave the best results in ambient and surface temperature tests, EPS provided the best insulation in the moisture test.

At Australia's largest urban re-development precinct, Fishermans Bend, seven known legacy landfills exist, as well as numerous other contamination sources (e.g. historical industrial spillages). Conventional landfill leachate indicators (e.g. ammonia-N and bicarbonate) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) were measured in 36 bores to distinguish leachate-impacted groundwater from non-impacted areas. Whilst eleven bores showed clear leachate impacts based on conventional indicators, others did not show clearly identifiable leachate signals, particularly those installed near landfills thought to have accepted a larger component of non-putrescible waste (e.g. industrial, construction and/or demolition waste). A new index for detection of legacy landfill leachate impact on groundwater was therefore developed, incorporating perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) as a proportion of PFAA (PFOA/\u2211PFAA) into an existing method based on leachate to native cation ratios, (\u2018L/N ratios\u2019).

Worldwide, it is estimated that Zn-ores contain 7\u201313 kt Ge, and coal and coal fly ash, 25\u2013112 kt. The production of Ge involves leaching followed by recovery of Ge by chlorination-distillation, precipitation, solvent extraction, ion flotation, supported liquid membranes, ion exchange, or solid-phase extraction. Leaching from Zn-refinery residues is primarily done with mineral acids, whereas from coal fly ash is achieved with organic ligands.

This work, which focuses on construction materials, is a part of a wider study evaluating the feasibility of self-sufficiency in the Portuguese region of \u00c9vora, and includes food production, energy production and water management. After identifying and quantifying the most important and widely used materials in construction within the region (both today and for the future), the study estimates the need and generation potential for each material so as to evaluate and compare them. The study is concentrated strictly within regionally defined boundaries and uses municipality level statistics as much as possible. Because it is a preliminary study, although the evaluation quantifies needs and generation potential, it does not consider details in terms of infrastructure, technology, human labour and/or cost implications. The durability of deposits and technological necessities are analyzed, for the local conditions, and assumptions concerning land occupation and the quantities of resources exploited will also be discussed. The materials analyzed amount to around 98% in mass of all the listed materials, which was considered a good start for a preliminary self-sufficiency resource management study. This research concludes that achieving regional self-sufficiency in construction materials requires a philosophical shift from new construction to maintenance and retrofitting. It also finds that reuse and recycling are major sources of materials that, combined with the previous conclusion, can secure lifetimes of hundreds or even thousands of years for naturally-occurring deposits, including sand, limestone and soils. Moreover, materials such as wood and soils can be crucial to the entire industry's self-sufficiency since they account for as much as 33% of all construction materials' use, in mass weight (replacing large quantities of concrete, sintered ceramics, metals and plastics). Finally, this work contributes to a better understanding of the conditions for, and consequences of, managing construction materials in a self-sufficient way, within a region.

Plant polyphenols and their coordination polymers have recently been regarded as a powerful tool for engineering functional nanomaterials. Herein, the recent progress of plant polyphenol-based coordination polymers and their derived functional mesoporous materials have been comprehensively reviewed. Firstly, based on the strong interactions between polyphenols and various assembly units (e.g., metal ions, soft-template) or substrates (e.g., polystyrene sphere), metal-polyphenol coordination polymers (MPCPs) with capsule structure, crystalline framework, colloidal spheres or mesoporous network can be prepared. Secondly, polyphenols are regarded as an excellent sustainable carbon source. When metal-polyphenol coordination polymers are used as a carbon precursor, mesoporous carbon materials including pure carbon, heteroatom doping, or metal nanoparticle loading are prepared. Thirdly, due to the tunable compositions of MPCPs, mesoporous metal oxide spheres with tunable metal species, solid or hollow structure, complex compositions (e.g., multi-metals or high-entropy metal oxides) are prepared. Fourthly, the applications of MPCPs derived mesoporous materials, including energy conversion and storage, environmental remediation and biomedicine, have been summarized.

Results indicate that the thermal conductivity decreased from 0.0794 to 0.0682 W / m . K when the DPP content increased from 10% to 40% (w/w). Similarly, the thermal diffusivity decreased with the increasing DPP content and became 0.034 mm 2 / s . However, this increased the water absorption (~5.6% at 40 wt . % in cold water). The compressive strength decreased with the addition of DPP, which was attributed to the filler agglomeration and low compatibility between PLA and DPP.

MW has been largely proposed for the processing of sludge or radioactive and toxic wastes including hospital waste, tyres and industrial scores. Researchers demonstrated that MW heating is an eco-friendly technology for waste detoxification because of higher sustainability and effectiveness as complete detoxification process if compared with established techniques such as incineration or conventional pyrolysis. Experimental data demonstrated that MW heating could be also considered as a preferable choice compared with conventional chemical-physical or heating techniques in treating contaminated soils when soils present natural or enhanced high dielectric features. Analogously, for sediment decontamination processes, only conventional thermal treatments can be similarly effective as MW heating, but requiring high temperatures and costs. Undoubtedly, MW-absorber and irradiated matrix heavily affect the MW effectiveness and energy requirements. In general, the main advantages of MW are very rapid process, selective and environmentally sustainable. This depends on the principle of dielectric heating that allows the activation of effective removal mechanisms, namely selective heating and contaminant stripping by water distillation. However, despite the demonstrated possibility of combining eco-friendly with very high removals, the growth of industrial MW applications is still limited due to the lack of several information, which, at the moment represents difficult challenges. In fact, literature mainly relies on lab-scale experiments, and extending the obtained achievements to full-scale still faces to many problems. This still makes MW rarely applied to real practises. Material characterisation, scaling-up, pilot, modelling, design and demonstration studies are strongly desired to bridge the gap between existing literature and full-scale applications, and moving to industrial/production scale.

They initially formed egalitarian groups which had members that were dependent upon one another for their survival. Over time, humans established a sedentary lifestyle (about 3000 to 12,000years ago) with increasing agricultural expertise, and as populations grew, certain groups formed complex civilizations and lost their egalitarian features due to the rise of despotic dominants. Within the past few thousand years, many individuals and their societies have transformed from an egalitarian status to become more independent, evolving from a quasi-eusocial existence to a more-or-less asocial (solitary or private) one, even though we live and work closer together in larger populations.               Many humans have progressively become so preoccupied with modern life, their jobs, the political establishment, and individual desires that they have lost their connection with Mother Nature, the biological system that bore them. Except for a small but very valuable, sometimes heroic few, many contemporary humans could not care less about other species that they coinhabit Earth with or the ecosystems that support them. Many humans are even losing touch with each other.               Within recent years, humans have raced almost unconsciously toward their biotic potential as an ultramodern, overpopulated cosmopolitan species. The question we must now ask ourselves is this: with all of the evolutionary changes the human species and its predecessors have undergone, have they managed to develop features that keep them from being overbearingly threatening to other species, themselves, and the world, or have they remained more animalistic and increased their high degree of arrogant dominance, aggression, and technological capabilities to the point of putting everything they know in harm's way?               The human population has grown technologically primarily since the commencement of Mesopotamian civilizations in Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires, all native to the territory of modern-day Iraq. Without predators to keep our numbers down and in spite of our wars, disease epidemics, flare-ups of genocide, and secret societies that have been adamant about eliminating what they feel represents the weaker segment of the human species, our cosmopolitan population has grown all too rapidly.               The large-scale beginning of the oil industry has been attributed to the drilling of a well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The first offshore oil well was drilled near Summerland, California, in 1887. It was only 300ft from the water's edge and connected to the land by a long wharf. The first well in marine waters that was not connected to the land was drilled at Caddo Lake, Louisiana, in 1911.               During the 1920s and 1930s, wells were drilled in the lakes, swamps, and bayous of southern Louisiana. The Model T was introduced in 1908, and by 1916, half of the cars in the United States were Model Ts (Berger, 2001; Williams et\u00a0al., 1992). By 2012, there were 240.5million cars and light trucks being driven in the United States alone, the largest vehicle population in the world. In 2010, the global number of cars exceeded 1.015billion.               Buying and selling petroleum products around the world has been big business, and getting petroleum from one country to another requires movement over water. That oil was being harvested for some time under marine waters and transported to other locations has been a disaster in the making. By the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, there had been oil spills all over the world, caused either by naval accidents or during major wars.               Oil spills are dangerous for all forms of life. Since at least half of the oxygen in the world is generated in the oceans, this is of particular importance to marine photoautotrophs and organisms that depend on them for an aerobic environment. Further, upon reaching the edges of a marine environment, precious mangrove environments and intertidal zones, areas that are extremely biodiverse, are affected, and this, in turn, affects terrestrial organisms. In addition to the ecological significance of mangrove and intertidal destruction, the die-off of sea creatures halts marine-related businesses and affects the livelihood of numerous people who depend on coastlines.               As disastrous as these oil spills have been to planetary abuse, we may wonder whether they were the beginning of coastline destruction? The Gulf of Mexico, like many other areas in the world that lie close to human populations, was a deteriorating ecological disaster area long before the release of oil, and the roots of these disasters, also from the hands of humans, are on land.               The Mississippi River is a mighty river that receives drainage water from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems throughout its course. Small and large streams and rivers throughout the Midwest drain extensive areas and flow into the Mississippi. Pesticides and fertilizers used by humans enter runoff which flows into the river, and they, along with vast amounts of other pollutants, are dumped into the Gulf of Mexico. These chemicals, which have killed unknown numbers of terrestrial and aquatic organisms en route to the Gulf, have subsequently created a dead zone in Gulf waters off the coast of Louisiana.               Some of the chemicals found in runoff promote the growth and reproduction of many marine microorganisms. Nitrogen-rich compounds found in fertilizer and waste material runoff provide nutrients that result in algal blooms. Upon the termination of a bloom, there is a great dying of organisms that sink to the bottom of the water and decompose, depleting the water of oxygen. It occurs in other waters around the world as well.               The Northern Gulf of Mexico's hypoxic waters represent one of the Western Hemisphere's largest \u201cdead zones\u201d\u2014areas where a lack of oxygen kills fish, crustaceans, and other marine life. The size of the Gulf zone varies but at its peak, it stretches along the inner continental shelf from the mouth of the Mississippi River westward to the upper Texas coast, covering about 7000square miles, an area as large as New Jersey. Long-term consequences to biodiversity, species abundance, and biomass in the Gulf are not yet known, but experience with other coastal dead zones has shown significant ecological deterioration and depleted fisheries.               One hundred and forty-six dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels were reported in 2003. Some of these were small, but the largest dead zone covered 70,000km2 (27,000 mi). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide, and in January 2011, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) identified 534 low-oxygen \u201cdead zones\u201d and an additional 228 sites worldwide exhibiting signs of marine eutrophication (areas with an overabundance of certain chemicals, e.g., fertilizers and pesticides). WRI has since discovered 13 additional sites that are already eutrophic and in danger of becoming dead zones, bringing the total number of coastal areas around the world known to be suffering from nutrient pollution at the time of this writing to 775.               Animal wastes, global climate shifts, anthropogenic influences, dwindling resources, pollution, and the destructive nature of humans are subsequently discussed in detail.

The floatability of six granulated post-consumer plastic - Polystyrene (PS), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET-S, PET-D) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC-M, PVC-D) - in the presence of tannic acid (wetting agent), and the performance of the flotation separation of five bi-component plastic mixtures - PS/PMMA, PS/PET-S, PS/PET-D, PS/PVC-M and PS/PVC-D - were evaluated. Moreover, the effect of the contact angle, density, size and shape of the particles was also analysed. Results showed that all plastics were naturally hydrophobic, with PS exhibiting the highest floatability. The contact angle and the flotation recovery of six plastics decreased with increasing tannic acid concentration, occurring depression of plastics at very low concentrations. Floatability differed also with the size and shape of plastic particles. For regular-shaped plastics (PS, PMMA and PVC-D) floatability decreased with the increase of particle size, while for lamellar-shaped particles (PET-D) floatability was slightly greater for coarser particles. Thus, plastic particles with small size, lamellar shape and low density present a greater floatability. The quality of separation varied with the mixture type, depending not only on the plastics hydrophobicity, but also on the size, density and shape of the particles, i.e. the particle weight. Flotation separation of plastics can be enhanced by differences in hydrophobicity. In addition, flotation separation improves if the most hydrophobic plastic, that floats, has a lamellar shape and lower density and if the most hydrophilic plastic, that sinks, has a regular shape and higher density.

The effectiveness of a hydrocyclone system for the separation of these plastics, using both water and calcium chloride solutions, has been investigated. In addition a qualitative procedure for the determination of the HIPS content of a mixed ABS/HIPS product, by selective dissolution in R-limonene, has been developed. It was found that the effective density of separation depended on the particle size and aspect ratio. As the particle size and aspect ratio decreased, the separation became more efficient and the offset between separation density and hydrocyclone medium density decreased.

This study analyzed the carbon footprint (CF) of butter and dairy blend products, with the focus on fat content and size and type of packaging (including product waste at the consumer level). The products analyzed were butter with 80% fat in 250-g wrap, 250-g tub, and 10-g mini tub, and blends with 80% and 60% fat in 250-g tubs. Life cycle assessment was used to account for all greenhouse gas emissions from cow to consumer. A critical aspect when calculating the CF is how emissions are allocated between different products. Here, allocation of raw milk between products was based on a weighted fat and protein content (1:1.7), based on the price paid for raw milk to dairy farmers. The CF (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) for 1kg of butter or blend (assuming no product waste at consumer) ranged from 5.2kg (blend with 60% fat content) to 9.3kg of CO2e (butter in 250-g tub). When including product waste at the consumer level, the CF ranged from 5.5kg of CO2e (blend with 60% fat content) to 14.7kg of CO2e (butter in mini tub). Fat content and the proportion of vegetable oil in products had the greatest effect on CF of the products, with lower fat content and a higher proportion of vegetable oil resulting in lower CF. Hence, if the same functionality as butter could be retained while shifting to lower fat and higher proportions of vegetable oil, the CF of the product would be decreased. Size and type of packaging were less important, but it is crucial to have the correct size and type of packaging to avoid product losses at the consumer.

Electrically aged (18 years outdoors at 6\u201310 kV) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cables were ground by mechanical or cryogenic procedures. The waste was studied in comparison with a PVC virgin resin and a PVC virgin formulation similar to that of the cables both in quantities of additives and structure of polymer. After successive extractions in acetone and benzene the base polymer and extracts were analysed by elemental analysis, GPC, viscometry, IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, TG, DSC, and several standard methods of plastic analysis (plasticizer absorption, static thermal stability, etc.). From the acetone extracted quantities and the plasticizer absorption measurements it appears that only 1\u20132% di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DOP) was lost during the service-life of cables and most of the initial quantity remained in the cable composition so only a small addition is necessary for the reprocessing. The IR spectra of polymer extracted from electrical cable waste exhibit important changes concerning double bonds and carbonyl groups. The T g value is higher for the waste material indicating that it was rigidized due to the polyene fragments arising from partial dehydrochlorination. This is also supported by the viscometric and GPC measurements, the PVC from waste having a higher molecular weight than virgin PVC. Based on T g curves and static thermal stability the following order of thermal stability has been established: PVC waste jacket<PVC electrical cable waste<virgin PVC<PVC virgin cable formulation.

Therefore, we comprehensively reviewed the current status of knowledge on microplastics in soil on detection, occurrence, characterization, source, and potential risk. Our review suggests that microplastics are ubiquitous in soil matrices globally. However, the research progress of microplastics in the soil is restricted by inherent technological inconsistencies and difficulties in analyzing particles in complex matrices, and studies on the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in soil environments remain very scarce, especially in Africa, South America, and Oceania. The consistency of the characteristics and composition of the microplastics in the aquatic environment and soil demonstrate they may share sources and exchange microplastics. Wide and varied sources of microplastic are constantly filling the soil, which causes the accumulation of microplastics in the soil. Studies on the effects and potential risks of microplastics in soil ecosystems are also reviewed. Limited research has shown that the combination and interaction of microplastics with contaminants they absorbed may affect soil health and function, and even migration along the food chain. The occurrence and impact of microplastic on the soil depend on the morphology, chemical components, and natural factors.

When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.

The fact that the pattern does not need to be removed from the mold is a significant challenge to the conventional casting methods, and this feature will make the LFC method always attractive.

However, recent studies have focused on surface sediments, and in China, the vertical distribution and characteristics of MPs in mangrove sediments remain poorly understood. In this study, sediment cores of 100 cm depth were collected from six representative mangroves in China to investigate MPs via chronological analysis. Futian had the highest abundance of MPs (0\u20133123 n/kg), followed by Dongfang, Yunxiao, Zhanjiang, Dongzhaigang and Fangchenggang. The earliest MPs occurring in mangroves were dated back to 1955, and their abundance increased exponentially from bottom to surface sediments. MPs were mainly white in color, fiber-shaped, 1000\u20135000 \u03bcm in size, and of polypropylene/polyethylene polymer types. Furthermore, the MPs in the urban mangrove also showed a higher diversity in color. The results showed that the MP stocks in the urbanized Futian mangrove reached 1828 mg/m3, an order of magnitude higher than in other areas (251 \u00b1 180 mg/m3), contributing to 0.0057 % of the carbon storage of the sediment. The abundance of MPs in mangrove sediments is expected to increase by 2.38\u20139.54 times by 2030, and therefore deserve further attention.", "qas": [{"id": "18847", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "microplastics", "answer_start": 94}, {"text": "polypropylene/polyethylene polymer types", "answer_start": 787}]}]}, {"context": "Food packaging systems mainly serve to contain and protect foods during their shelf-lives. However, it is well known that a package is responsible for several environmental impacts associated with its entire life-cycle. Therefore, package design should be developed taking into account not only cost, food shelf-life and safety, as well as user-friendliness, but also environmental sustainability. To address and improve this latter issue, environmental evaluation methodologies need to be applied: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one amongst them, and can be considered a valid tool for this purpose. Indeed, it has been long applied in the food packaging field to highlight both environmental hotspots and improvement potentials for more eco-friendly products. In this context, this paper reports upon an LCA application experience in the production of foamy Polylactic Acid (PLA) trays for fresh-food packaging applications. The study highlighted that the highest environmental impacts come from the production and transport of the granules, so remarking the need to search for alternative biopolymers. In this regard, the results of this study will form the base for another one regarding the assessment of second-generation PLA granules, namely those produced by processing both wastes and wastewaters from starchy crop cultivation systems and processing plants.", "qas": [{"id": "18848", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the reactants used?", "answers": [{"text": "alternative biopolymers", "answer_start": 1080}, {"text": "wastes", "answer_start": 1283}, {"text": "wastewaters", "answer_start": 1294}]}]}]
