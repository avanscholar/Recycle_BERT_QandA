      "Prediction: ['degradation', 'degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high - value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron ( III ) chloride. The iron ( III ) - tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono - and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton - type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites ( sulfonated groups ) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon - to - sulphur atom ( C / S ) ratio can vary from 8 : 1 to 29 : 1.

      "Prediction: ['degradation', 'degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high - value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron ( III ) chloride. The iron ( III ) - tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono - and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton - type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites ( sulfonated groups ) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon - to - sulphur atom ( C / S ) ratio can vary from 8 : 1 to 29 : 1.

However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament. The bio - oil produced by the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high yield and HHV with great potential to replace fossil fuel, but contains a high acid value of about 120 mg KOH / g. Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio - oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA - 15 @ MgO @ Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio - oil. Moreover, co - pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio - oil yield and quality. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the production of biofuels using conventional and advanced pyrolysis']\n",
