[{"context": "A substantial growth in the consumption of plastic is observed all over the world in recent years, which has led to huge quantities of plastic-related waste. Recycling of plastic waste to produce new materials like concrete or mortar appears as one of the best solution for disposing of plastic waste, due to its economic and ecological advantages. Several works have been performed or are under way to evaluate the properties of cement-composites containing various types of plastic waste as aggregate, filler or fibre. This paper presents a review on the recycling plastic waste as aggregate in cement mortar and concrete productions. For better presentation, the paper is divided into four different sections along with introduction and conclusion sections. In the first section, types of plastics and types of methods used to prepare plastic aggregate as well as the methods of evaluation of various properties of aggregate and concrete were briefly discussed. In the next two sections, the properties of plastic aggregates and the various fresh and hardened concrete properties of cement mortar and concrete in presence of plastic aggregate are discussed.

However, one notable drawback is that concrete has a lower tensile strength, which causes microcracks when subjected to persistent pressure and harsh weather conditions. The service life of a structure is mostly determined by its concrete strength; in other words, moderate environmental conditions may strengthen it, while severe environmental conditions may weaken it. The degradation of concrete materials is also induced by bio-corrosion produced by microorganisms that generate sulphuric acid to make sulphate. The source of durability and repair system issues is a lack of concrete supply. Bacterial uses in concrete rehabilitation, pore-clogging, and cracking have all been investigated. Bacillus species are tiny creatures that are gram-positive, spore-forming, oxygen-dependent, and have dormant, thick-walled cells. They may live for up to 200 years as spore-forming bacteria.

One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle. To quantify the environmental feasibility of this concept, life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, in combination with a real case study (i.e., a concrete sidewalk in Montreal, Canada) are both assessed. More specifically, two different scenarios are compared, the business-as-usual (BAU) concrete production model, and a glass powder (GP) concrete production process model. All modeling efforts are performed using SimaPro 8.2 software, the Ecoinvent 3.2 database and the IMPACT 2002 + impact method. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation, in addition to different sensitivity analyses, are carried out to assess the influence of data uncertainty and key parameter changes, such as the distance from suppliers, potential lifetime extension of the concrete, and possible particulate emissions during GP production. Results show the environmental benefits of using GP as an ACM in terms of every indicator. Moreover, the significant contribution of cement production in the environmental burden of concrete is noted. It appears as the main hotspot in most midpoint indicators, and in all four endpoint indicators. It is especially highlighted as a global warming indicator, with 74% of the greenhouse gasses (GHG) related to cement production for the BAU scenario and 68% for the GP scenario. The emissions of particles into the atmosphere (such as CO2, NOx, and SOx) from the clinker kiln chimney plays a major role in the overall environmental impact of concrete production. Another key result is the importance of transportation distance of the base materials, which could reverse the conclusion. The originality of this paper relies on the environmental assessment of the up-cycling of GP as a supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in concrete.

This study aims to characterise the healing performance of waste-derived bitumen before and after pressure ageing vessel (PAV) ageing based on the crack length. One waste-derived bitumen was fabricated by blending the bio-oil pyrolysed from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (5 wt%) with a control bitumen (X70) using a high shear mixer at a speed of 150 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 30 min at 150 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. A second waste-derived bitumen was fabricated using the low-density polyethene (LDPE) and mixed with the control bitumen at a concentration of 6 wt% at a speed of 900RPM for 90 min at 180 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. Crack length-based healing index and Ramberg-Osgood model were employed to characterise the healing rate and healing capability of the bitumen, respectively. Material properties (e.g., relaxation modulus and surface energy) of the bitumen used in the healing models were calibrated by linear amplitude sweep test (10 Hz and 20 \u00b0C), frequency sweep test (10 Hz, 10\u201370 \u00b0C), and time sweep fatigue-healing test (10 Hz and 20 \u00b0C) at a controlled strain level of 5% with different rest durations. Advancing contact angles used in the healing models of the bitumen were measured by a sessile drop tensiometer based on the tilting cradle method. Results show that the bio-oil productively promotes the healing potential and capability of the unaged bitumen, and the LDPE slightly strengthens them. The PAV ageing process evaporates most of the modifier bio-oil; hence, the PAV-aged bio-oil modified bitumen does not show better healing performance than that of the PAV-aged control bitumen. The PAV-aged LDPE modified bitumen has much better healing performance than those of the PAV-aged control bitumen and the PAV-aged bio-oil modified bitumen. The short-term healing rate and healing potential dominate the healing behaviours of the bitumen. The unaged bio-oil modified bitumen heals the fastest (having the highest short-term healing rate) and most (having the highest healing potential), followed by the unaged LDPE modified bitumen, and the unaged control bitumen heals the least and slowest. The PAV-aged LDPE modified bitumen heals the fastest and most, followed by the PAV-aged bio-oil modified bitumen and the PAV-aged control bitumen. The fundamental reason for LDPE's enhancement to bitumen's healing is that the LDPE increased the deformation recovery ability of the bitumen, leading to a higher wetting rate of the cracked surfaces and thus a higher short-term healing rate. However, the LDPE in bitumen cannot accelerate the molecular diffusion to increase the intrinsic healing or the long-term healing rate.", "qas": [{"id": "12413", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "waste-derived bitumen", "answer_start": 526}, {"text": "One waste-derived bitumen", "answer_start": 628}, {"text": "control bitumen", "answer_start": 769}, {"text": "oil", "answer_start": 689}, {"text": "A second waste-derived bitumen", "answer_start": 911}, {"text": "bitumen", "answer_start": 540}, {"text": "(e.g., relaxation modulus surface energy", "answer_start": 3147}, {"text": "bio-oil productively", "answer_start": 1790}, {"text": "unaged bitumen", "answer_start": 1864}, {"text": "PAV-aged bio-oil modified bitumen", "answer_start": 1995}, {"text": "PAV-aged control bitumen", "answer_start": 2087}, {"text": "The PAV-aged LDPE modified bitumen", "answer_start": 2113}, {"text": "The unaged bio-oil modified bitumen", "answer_start": 2368}, {"text": "unaged LDPE modified bitumen", "answer_start": 2532}, {"text": "unaged control bitumen", "answer_start": 2570}, {"text": "bitumen's healing", "answer_start": 2818}]}]}, {"context": "One sector where the use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is supposed to offer novel or improved functionalities is the construction industry.

Pyrolysis has been proposed as a viable processing route for recycling the organic compounds in WEEE plastics into fuels and chemical feedstock. However, dehalogenation procedures are also necessary during treat process, because the oils collected in single pyrolysis process may contain numerous halogenated organic compounds, which would detrimentally impact the reuse of these pyrolysis oils. Currently, dehalogenation has become a significant topic in recycling of WEEE plastics by pyrolysis. In order to fulfill the better resource utilization of the WEEE plastics, the compositions, characteristics and dehalogenation methods during the pyrolysis recycling process of WEEE plastics were reviewed in this paper. Dehalogenation and the decomposition or pyrolysis of WEEE plastics can be carried out simultaneously or successively. It could be \u2018dehalogenating prior to pyrolysing plastics\u2019, \u2018performing dehalogenation and pyrolysis at the same time\u2019 or \u2018pyrolysing plastics first then upgrading pyrolysis oils\u2019.

The second strategy is the most common method. Zeolite or other type of catalyst can be used in the pyrolysis process for removing organohalogens.

The main focus of the research was to manipulate the H2:CO ratio in the syngas for targeted end-use applications by optimizing the process conditions, including the input steam/CO2 reforming gas ratio. The experimental results showed that at higher steam:CO2 ratios, there was a marked increase in H2 yield due to the endothermic nature of the steam and CO2 reforming processes.

As a result, polymeric material-based waste has been accumulating, and now can be found not only in designated waste tips on land, but also as pollution all over the world. Therefore, it is timely to accelerate global recycling plans to minimize the use of natural resources. At present, end-of-life vehicles (EOLV) and electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) are two major sources of waste. Such waste includes a combination of polymers, which are hard to separate. Because the properties of blends of polymer are not well-understood, the recycling opportunities for such wastes are hindered. Hence, this paper aims to extend the knowledge concerning the re-processing of such recycled polymers, as a first step towards developing a more effective circular manufacturing economy. Three types of recycled polymers were tested under various processing conditions, and the effects of six different process parameters were investigated, including chip size and morphology. The results confirm that properties and processing behaviour of recycled materials can be highly variable, and hence difficult to predict. This highlights the importance of better selection and screening of scrap polymers, to remove undesirable content from the material batch. Knowing the exact constituents of each batch of material to be recycled means that appropriate process settings can be selected, to achieve better material properties in the recycled end product. In addition, energy and materials costs can be reduced by optimizing process parameters such as the set temperatures, pressures, and product dimensions.

Here, by taking solid potato waste (SPW) as a typical solid food waste, the impact of waste activated sludge (WAS) as a second waste to introduce synergistic effects between them to enhance waste-to-power conversion in microbial fuel cell (MFC) was systematically investigated. For the MFCs with seven different mixing ratios of SPW and WAS, the MFC with mixing ratio of 6:1 produced the highest maximum current density and maximum power density of 320.1 mA/m2 and 14.1 mW/m2. Mixing larger ratios of WAS (2:1 and 4:1) resulted in only a very slight increase in coulombic efficiency; while mixing smaller ratios of WAS (6:1, 8:1 and 10:1) significantly increased the coulombic efficiency, and the coulombic efficiency showed an obvious increase as the WAS mixing ratio decreased. Less humic acid- and fulvic acid-like substances were formed from the hydrolysis and degradation of SPW and WAS, and most of dissolved macromolecular organic matters were hydrolyzed into organic fractions with small molecular weight. Principal component analysis indicated that the composition of dissolved organic matters was significantly influenced by different mixing ratios of SPW and WAS throughout the operation.

LDPE was thermally degraded to oil at 425\u00b0C however, beyond this temperature the proportion of oil product decreased as a result of its conversion to char and hydrocarbon gas. Compositional analysis of the oil products showed that aliphatic hydrocarbons were the major components, but the proportion of aromatic compounds increased at higher temperatures and residence times. On the other hand, PS degraded at around 350\u00b0C, mainly into a viscous dark-coloured oil. The formation of char only increased marginally until 425\u00b0C, but was dramatically enhanced at 450 and 500\u00b0C, reaching up to 30wt.%. The oil product from PS even at 350\u00b0C consisted almost entirely of aromatic compounds especially toluene, ethylbenzene and styrene. Under increasing temperatures and residence times, the oil product from PS was preferentially converted to char, while gas formation was preferred for the oil from LDPE. For instance at 500\u00b0C, PS produced about twice the amount of char obtained from LDPE indicating the role of aromatic compounds in char formation via condensation of the aromatic ring structure. During the co-pyrolysis of a 7:3 mixture of LDPE and PS, wax product was observed at 350\u00b0C leading to oil at 400\u00b0C, indicating that the presence of PS influenced the conversion of LDPE by lowering its degradation temperature.

To date, existing types of pyrolysis include conventional pyrolysis (poor heat transfer due to non-selective heating), vacuum pyrolysis (lower process temperature because of vacuum), solar pyrolysis (entirely \u201cgreen\u201d with solar-powered), and a newly touted microwave pyrolysis. In microwave pyrolysis of biomass, the heat transfer is more efficient as the heat is generated within the core of material by the interaction of microwave with biomass. The plausible mechanisms of microwave heating are dipole polarization, ionic conduction and interfacial polarization. The lack of top-tier reactor design is identified as the main obstacle that impedes the commercialization of microwave pyrolysis in biomass recycling. Based on the existing works, it is surmised that microwave pyrolysis of biomass produces solid biochar as a main product. To confront the great market demand of activated biochar, it is proposed that the solid char could be upgraded into engineered activated biochar with desirable properties for wide application in pollution control, catalysis and energy storage. Hence, the production of engineered activated biochar from microwave pyrolysis process and its applications are reviewed and explicitly discussed to fill the research gap, and the key implications for future development are highlighted.", "qas": [{"id": "12481", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "value-added products", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "energy recovery", "answer_start": 69}, {"text": "low pollutant emission diverse products formation", "answer_start": 1769}, {"text": "products", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "main product", "answer_start": 1275}, {"text": "energy storage", "answer_start": 1517}, {"text": "production", "answer_start": 1544}]}]}, {"context": "This work describes the procedure for manufacturing a beam-filling piece for the construction and/or rehabilitation of traditional timber-beam floor structures using pieces made of cement mortars with aggregates consisting of mixed polypropylene plastic (PP) waste from urban waste collection plants.

Deinking of papers printed by 21 different copiers and laser printers was tested under mild-conditions. It was attested that both the toner and the printing machine play an important role in the deinkability. The deinking efficiency varied significantly across different cases, spanning from low values (<100 mm2 specks surface per m2 deinked paper surface) to high values (>1,000 mm2 specks surface per m2 recycled paper surface). It was proved that the presence of styrene-acrylate copolymers and iron oxides in the toner resulted in reduced deinkability. In addition, slow printing speed had also a negative impact on the deinking efficiency. According to the research conducted, the removal of particles larger than 150 \u03bcm is a decisive factor in the deinking process. It was also demonstrated that the deinkability of office waste paper highly depends on the pulping conditions i.e. temperature, time and consistency. In particular, the highest deinkability was recorded when the three factors had simultaneously the highest values. Under these conditions, approximately 98% decrease in the total specks surface was achieved by flotation.

Currently, most of the MSW around the world is processed/disposed of via landfill and incineration, although recycling and upcycling are expected to grow in the years to come. There is a growing number of countries composting the organic fraction of MSW to produce soil amendments, but these processes tend to be costly and result in products with low added value.

To better manage MSW, the development of a new business model, forms of management, and technological paradigms are needed. The innovation in new policies and business models for MSW management is likely to result in economic growth, and importantly, sustainability. This chapter focuses on the need for creating a circular economy around MSW recycling. We will examine some emerging technologies (anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal liquefaction, wet oxidation, pyrolysis, hydrocracking, and gasification) and discuss how these technologies could play into novel biorefineries concepts for processing of MSWs.

This amount of plastic waste is forcing society to develop sustainable recycling strategies. For this reason, commercially available PP feedstocks made from post-consumer waste are available for manufacturing.

PP is a material that is typically challenging to process by ME-AM due to its high crystallinity, high shrinkage, and poor adhesion properties. Therefore, this work investigates the use and applicability of PP recyclates in ME-AM. For this purpose, filaments were produced from a commercial grade PP recyclate and tensile specimens were printed with different printing parameters.

High amount of organic material, particularly food waste (approximately 45%) can be found in the solid waste in this country. Being the most practical solution, landfilling however does not seem to be the most rational approach considering its byproducts, i.e. methane gas and fluidic leachate which could cause high contamination to the air and water. Lately, researchers have placed emphasis in food waste as its high organic content has a great potential of being turned into ethanol or a source of biofuel. Bioethanol is one of the most promising alternative energy sources to diminish the dependence on fossil fuel. It could be produced by the fermentation of sugar-rich crops and food wastes. This paper investigates the use of an electrostatic separator to segregate the food waste and non-food waste from the waste mixtures. Electrostatic separator is capable of separating particles based on the conductivities of the constituent components. It is widely used to sort out particles with high conductivities from those with relatively low conductivities, e.g. to recover conductors from non-conducting mixtures, serving as an environmentally friendly way for recycling without negative impact to the surrounding. In this study, influences of various volumetric ratios of non-food waste, i.e. plastic and glass, on recovery process of food waste would be studied. The findings contribute to reduction of landfill size with rare existence of organic matters in landfills.

With certain chemicals and additives (pigments, concentrates, anti-blockers, light transformers (LTs), UV-stabilizers, etc.), they become what we know as plastics. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an in depth analysis regarding the recovery, treatment and recycling routes of plastic solid waste (PSW), as well as the main advantages and disadvantages associated with every route. Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-\u03b1-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste. Nevertheless, due to their high calorific value and embodied energy, plastics are being incinerated solely or in combination with municipal solid waste (MSW) in many developed countries. This review also presents a number of application and technologies currently being used to incinerate plastics. Cement kilns and fluidized beds are the two most common units used to recover energy from PSW or MSW with high PSW content.

PHAs does not cause any type of hazardous pollution upon disposal. However, the high production cost of PHAs makes its wider acceptability unsuitable at commercial level. This can be minimized by screening potential PHAs producing strains, selecting inexpensive raw material, optimized cultivation condition and by adopting efficient recovery and purification strategies. Scope and approach The PHA upstream processing is expensive and contributes approximately 40% of total production cost. This can be minimized to greater extent by using inexpensive raw materials such as agro-industrial waste and lignocellulose waste (LCW). In recent time, LCW has gained more attention in bioprocess-based production owing to its nutritional composition. LCW is rich in complex polysaccharides such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose which are not easily digested. Hydrothermal processing of lignocellulosic materials causes a variety of effects including extractive removal, hemicellulose hydrolysis and alteration of the properties of both cellulose and lignin. The extracted digested residues can be effectively utilized in PHAs and copolymer synthesis. Key findings and conclusion: This review focusses on various aspects of hydrothermal processing of lignocellulosic waste for efficient and economical PHAs production. These bio-plastics specifically microbial produced bio-polymers such as PHAs find application in food industries as packaging material owing to their desirable water barrier and gas permeability properties in addition to complete biodegradability upon disposal without green-house gas emission.

Expanded packaging can also be made from renewable and biodegradable raw materials. In this case, the use of a renewable feedstock, such as starch, can reduce the oil dependence and biodegradability can enable the organic recycling of the final product. In this study, a life cycle assessment was performed on a prototype (a port-hole spacer for washing machines) developed in a research project by applying a biodegradable plastic expanded by means of microwave technology. Port-hole spacers for washing machines are mainly made from expanded polystyrene. Life cycle assessment results indicate that the prototype is characterized by a lower consumption of non-renewable energy resources (\u221250%) and lower greenhouse gas emissions (\u221260%) compared to the benchmark (expanded polystyrene packaging). This was mainly due to the use of a renewable feedstock (starch). The photochemical ozone creation potential resulted significantly lower (\u221290%) thanks to the abolition of the expanding agent (i.e. pentane) used in the polystyrene expansion process. The robustness of the results was assessed through data quality checks and a Monte Carlo simulation. A sensitivity analysis showed that the environmental profile of the prototype is mainly affected by the Land Use Change for global warming potential and by the type of starch used for eutrophication and acidification. The type of electricity used (i.e. fossil-based or renewable) for the microwave expansion process also affects the results. The use of biodegradable packaging makes it possible to increase the level of recovery by means of organic recycling. Considering the organic recycling rate in the countries where the washing machines are supplied it has been estimated that the cushioning packaging waste that goes to landfill would go from 52% (current scenario with expanded polystyrene packaging) to 37%, whereas recycling would go from 0.5% (mechanical recycling of expanded polystyrene) to 40% (organic recycling of the prototype).

It can be argued that the combination of the use of renewable resources, and the possibility to get a compostable packaging product give rise to interesting future outlook.

One of the solutions to address this problem is recycling of plastic products. Plastic recycling is the output of intermediate stages of collection, sorting by type, and processing of polymers. Plastic recycling reduces the quantity of residues in landfills and those indiscriminately discarded in the environment. Thus recycling lead to reducing the chance of diseases spread due to contamination of water, air and soil. In this article, plastic recycling as the state of art review has been projected with prospect to minimize the environmental pollution. Three different case studies of plastic recycling by reinforcement of banana fiber (BF) in polymer matrix have been presented for field engineers. The thermoplastics (like: ABS, PA6, HDPE and LDPE) have been selected (based upon their field applications) and extruded by twin screw extrusion (TSE) in filament form (Diameter: 1.75 mm) for 3D printing applications.

Unfortunately, most post-consumer rubber-derived products are still discarded as waste, buried in landfills or incinerated. Such materials require many years to degrade naturally due to i) their complex cross-linked composition, and ii) the additives used during manufacturing to extend the lifespan of rubber. Extensive research has investigated the use of end-of-life rubber as binder (e.g. elastomers, bitumen), or as conglomerates (cement, gypsums) to produce innovative composites in construction. To improve the properties of composites made with recycled rubber, the surface of rubber has been treated with different costly processes to improve the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ). However, the results available in the literature are inconsistent and many technical and practical aspects remain unsolved, thus preventing the cost-effective use of rubber in the construction industry. This study provides a comprehensive review on rubber properties and surface treatments of rubber recycled from post-consumer components so as to identify potential applications in composites for construction.

Owing to the unsatisfactory quality of fuels from non-catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis was proposed to improve especially the properties of liquid fuel in the presence of catalyst. Catalyst is thus an essential parameter in catalytic pyrolysis, as the specifications of catalysts could show profound influence on composition of the liquid fuel. Specifically, the formulation of catalyst, the exposed surface species, the acidic sites, the porous structures, etc all affect catalytic performances in pyrolysis of municipal solid waste. Up to now, there have been a number of catalysts developed for catalytic pyrolysis of the mixture of municipal solid waste.

The management of radioactive waste has international applications regarding discharges of radioactive effluents into the environment and to final disposal of waste. The need for the prevention of environmental contamination and the isolation of some radionuclides, especially long-lived radionuclides, for longer periods of time than national boundaries or limits, have remained stable in the past, require some new waste management methods based on internationally agreed criteria and standards. Radioactive waste is usually generated by uranium or any other radioactive material mining, nuclear power plants, testing and manufacturing of military weapons, and by hospitals and universities that use radioactive materials for research and treatment. Radioactive contaminants are chemical elements with an unstable and unbalanced number of protons and neutrons resulting from unstable atoms that may emit ionizing radiation. Examples of radioactive contaminants include cesium, plutonium, and uranium. They are generally termed as radionuclides. Radioactive contaminants may enter water from soils, disposal and storage of radioactive wastes, and from miming practices of phosphorus and uranium.

Cylindrical specimens (50 \u00d7 100 mm) were made with metakaolin (MK) and natural sand as precursors, whereas a mixture of NaOH in pearls + glass polishing waste, dissolved in water in two different orders (A: dry mixing of both activators and B: NaOH was dissolved in water and then the glass waste was added) was used as an alkaline solution, in addition to a reference mixture (without waste). The dosage used a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio = 2.5 and 3.0. The specimens were subjected to ambient and thermal curing (60 \u00b0C) for 7 days and then submitted to laboratory for measuring the durability of wetting and drying cycles, saline environment and thermal shock. It can be observed that in the evaluation of wetting and drying cycles, the type A mixture with a molar ratio of 3.0 in ambient cure obtained a weight loss of 10 %, while in mechanical strength with a molar ratio of 2.5 and thermal cure the reduction was 27.34 %. Meanwhile, in the durability to salt exposure, both processing conditions were satisfactory, with a molar ratio of 3.0, with type A and thermal cure with a loss of mass of 11.25 %. In the evaluation of thermal shock, the mixture with the smallest loss of mechanical strength was the molar ratio of 2.5, type A with ambient cure. It can be concluded that forthe conditions evaluated, the mixture with a molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 = 2.5, using type A processing in the ambient cure, presented the smallest losses in mass and mechanical strength in comparative terms, adapting to the values of literature for mortars.", "qas": [{"id": "12721", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "added value", "answer_start": 218}, {"text": "geopolymeric mortars", "answer_start": 391}, {"text": "mortars", "answer_start": 404}]}]}, {"context": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastic is applied to railway car bodies to lighten them and reduce fuel consumption.

Evidence acquisition MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from January 1, 1990 to April 2021. We included studies assessing carbon footprint (CF) in the OR and articles detailing actions that limit or reduce CF. Evidence synthesis Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. We identified six core climate-smart actions: (1) waste reduction by segregation; (2) waste reduction by recycling, reuse, and reprocessing; (3) sterilisation; (4) anaesthesia gas management; and (5) improvement of energy use. Quantitative analysis regarding the CF was not possible due to the lack of homogeneous data. For climate-smart actions, the analysis was limited by discrepancies in study scope and in the methodology of CO2 emission calculation. Improvement of education and awareness was found to have an important impact on waste segregation and reduction. Waste management is the area where health care workers could have the strongest impact, whereas the main field to reduce CF in the OR was found to be energy consumption.

We investigated a method of increasing the addition rate of waste plastics without affecting coke strength by charging coal and plastic separately in a coke oven chamber. In the case of the same plastic addition rate, charging the plastic in the bottom or the top part of the coke oven chamber can decrease the deterioration of coke strength compared with charging a homogeneous mixture of coal and plastic. Charging the plastic in the bottom decreases the coke strength to a greater extent than charging the plastic in the top. This is because the decomposition of the plastic charged in the bottom decreases the bulk density of the upper coal layer.

The complex overview on changes in policy and approach to waste tyres that leads to both solving environmental problem of post-consumer tyres and creating environmentally friendlier novel materials are presented. It is shown that in the world, the amount of polymer wastes increases every year. Most of them are in the form of post-consumer tyres. Recycling and recovery of such tyres is a serious environmental problem due to their very complex structure and composition. Moreover, storage of the whole post-consumer tyres takes a lot of space in landfills and pollute the environment. However, recently it has been reported a great progress in sustainable management of waste tyres. An important role in the progress of tyre recovery has played the establishment of the restrictive regulations, which prohibits stockpiling of tyres in landfills. This legislative steps have contributed to significant impact on the progress in the development of car tyres recovery. The most important is introducing of monitoring for improper stockpiling, producer responsibility for wastes tyres and the new tax system. With the help of mentioned changes and introducing environmentally friendlier technologies it appeared that the utilization of tyres can be cost effective. The applied technology can transform post-consumer tyres into a source of energy or valuable raw materials, from which can be obtained a wide range of sustainable polymeric composite materials characterized by quite good mechanical and functional properties. This new approach to post consumer tyres is undertaken in U.S., China, Japan and EU. From the overview it is clear that the grinded used tyres should not be treated any more as a pollutant but rather as a source of sustainable materials. Those materials belong to modern polymer-rubber composites obtained mainly from elastomers (natural and synthetic rubbers) or thermoplastics (PE, PP, PVC).

Radiation and radioactive substances have many beneficial applications, ranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry, and agriculture. The world is undergoing rapid developments where government administrators and people are giving emphasis to sustainable energy sources without pollution. Being a clean source of energy, nuclear energy is a preferable option to meet the energy requirements in different sectors and it does not contribute to greenhouse gases that contaminate our environment. The radioactive materials, which are, usually the by-products of the nuclear energy generation and other applications of nuclear fission, research, and medicine are commonly referred to as the radioactive wastes. Radioactive waste (or nuclear waste) is a material deemed no longer useful that has been contaminated by or contains radionuclides. Radionuclides are unstable atoms of an element that decay, or disintegrate spontaneously, emitting energy in the form of radiation. There are approximately 5000 natural and artificial radionuclides that have been identified, each with a different half-life. Radioactive wastes are generated during nuclear fuel cycle operation, production, and application of radioisotope in medicine, industry, research, and agriculture, and as a by-product of natural resource exploitation, which includes mining and processing of ores, combustion of fossil fuels, or production of natural gas and oil. Waste from nuclear weapons and reprocessing units usually contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239, which is a fissile material used in explosives, high specific activity material Pu-238 or Po, 3H, and Am-241. Medical wastes generally contain beta particles and gamma ray emitters varying from Y-90, I-131, Sr-89, Ir-192, Co-60, Cs-137, and few other isotopes that are used for medical applications. Naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) includes all radioactive elements found in the environment. Long-lived radioactive elements such as U, Th, and K and their decay products viz. Ra and Rn are examples of NORM. These elements have always been present in the Earth\u2019s crust and are concentrated in some areas, such as uranium ore builds which may be mined. The coal industry, oil and gas industry, metal mining and smelting, mineral sands, fertilizers industry, building industry are few activities that generally contain NORM. The quantum of radioactive waste in a country is dependent upon the scale of applications and range of activities associated with nuclear and radioactive mineral utilization. If not handled properly, radioactive wastes are deleterious to most forms of life as well as to the environment. The radioactive elements (radionuclides) cannot be destroyed by any known chemical or mechanical process. Their ultimate destruction is through radio-decay as stable isotopes or by nuclear transmutation by bombardment with atomic particles. Consequently, radioactive waste management consists of controlling and reducing the radioactive releases to tolerable levels. Removal of radionuclides from effluents and solid wastes is done by concentrating them into a form which can be stored or disposed of in a manner that they do not appear in hazardous concentrations in an ecosystem.

Its remarkable range of properties (e.g., durability, lightweight, good barrier properties) combined with the ease of processing make plastic a sustainable alternative over other materials (e.g., glass, metals, and paper), of which production, use, and management can be more resource intensive. Owing to these attributes, plastics are considered to have an important role to play in promoting sustainability as part of a circular economy (CE). CE is a concept that seeks to promote a sustainable way of living, where resources are used more efficiently and are retained in the economy for as long as possible. The latter can be achieved by creating loops that feed resources back into the system for use in same or new components and products with the same or lower functionality. Paradoxically, plastics present also one of the biggest challenges to achieving a CE. This is because, in spite of their great potential to promote resource efficiency upstream, i.e., at the production stage, a vast amount of the plastic that becomes waste escapes into the environment and/or is largely mismanaged at the consumption and management stage. This highlights the urgent need for scrutiny in the way plastics are designed, produced, used, and managed, to better understand how to improve their ability to circulate back into the system, recovering maximum value from them. In this chapter, we present a framework for plastic waste management placing emphasis on their circularity potential via existing processes. Given the rapid emergence of bioplastics in the plastic industry, it would be an omission not to discuss their opportunities and implications in promoting circularity.

Trillions of cigarettes are produced every year worldwide, resulting in millions of tonnes of toxic waste being dumped into the environment in the form of cigarette butts. As CBs have poor biodegradability, it can take many years for them to break down. This paper reviews and presents some of the results of a study on the recycling of CBs into fired clay bricks. Bricks with 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% CB content by weight were manufactured and tested, and then compared against control clay bricks with 0% CB content. The results showed that the dry density decreased by up to 30% and the compressive strength decreased by 88% in bricks with 10% CBs. The calculated compressive strength of bricks with 1% CBs was determined to be 19.53Mpa. To investigate the effect of mixing time, bricks with 7.5% CB content were manufactured with different mixing times of 5, 10, and 15min. To test the effect of heating time on the properties of CB bricks, the heating rate used during manufacturing was changed to 0.7, 2, 5, and 10\u00b0Cmin\u22121. Bricks with 0% and 5% CB content were fired with these heating rates. Leachate tests were carried out for bricks with 0%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% CB content. The emissions released during firing were tested for bricks with 0% and 5% CB content using heating rates of 0.7, 2, 5, and 10\u00b0Cmin\u22121. The gases tested were carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorine (Cl2), nitrogen oxide (NO), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Finally, estimations were made for the energy that could be saved by firing bricks incorporating CBs. Calculations showed that up to 58% of the firing energy could potentially be saved. Bricks were shown to be a viable solution for the disposal of CBs. They can reduce contamination caused by cigarette butts and provide a masonry construction material that can be either loadbearing or non-loadbearing, depending on the quantity of CBs incorporated. This paper proposes the use of bricks with 1% CB content throughout the brick-manufacturing industry. If bricks contained as little as 1% CB content, they would still provide a solution for the issue of CB recycling while maintaining properties very similar to those of a non-CB brick.

Subsequently, enrichment of HBCDDs was found in nearby marine sediments and mussels growing on EPS buoys. It was suspected that EPS buoys and their debris might be sources of HBCDDs. To confirm this, the release of HBCDDs from EPS spherules detached from a buoy to seawater was investigated under field (open sea surface and closed outdoor chambers with sun exposure and in the dark) and laboratory (particle-size) conditions. In all exposure groups, initial rapid leaching of HBCDDs was followed by slow desorption over time. Abundant release of HBCDDs was observed from EPS spherules exposed to the open sea surface (natural) and on exposure to sunlight irradiation or in the dark in controlled saline water. Water leaching and UV-light/temperature along with possibly biodegradation were responsible for about 37% and 12% of HBCDDs flux, respectively. Crumbled EPS particles (\u22641 mm) in samples deployed on the sea surface for 6 months showed a high degree of weathering. This implies that surface erosion and further fragmentation of EPS via environmental weathering could enhance the leaching of HBCDDs from the surface of EPS. Overall, in the marine environment, HBCDDs could be released to a great extent from EPS products and their debris due to the cumulative effects of the movement of large volumes of water (dilution), biodegradation, UV-light/temperature, wave action (shaking), salinity and further fragmentation of EPS spherules.", "qas": [{"id": "12944", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "Expanded polystyrene", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "EPS products", "answer_start": 1401}]}]}, {"context": "The aim of this research was to separate the different plastics of a mixed post-consumer plastic waste by the combination of a three-stage sink\u2013float method and selective flotation.

Food waste is commonly disposed of in landfills or incinerated, causing many environmental, social, and economic issues. Large amounts of food waste are produced in the food supply chain of agriculture: production, post-harvest, distribution (transport), processing, and consumption. Food waste can be valorised into a range of products, including biofertilisers, bioplastics, biofuels, chemicals, and nutraceuticals. Conversion of food waste into these products can reduce the demand of fossil-derived products, which have historically contributed to large amounts of pollution. The variety of food chain suppliers offers a wide range of feedstocks that can be physically, chemically, or biologically altered to form an array of biofertilisers and soil amendments. Composting and anaerobic digestion are the main large-scale conversion methods used today to valorise food waste products to biofertilisers and soil amendments. However, emerging conversion methods such as dehydration, biochar production, and chemical hydrolysis have promising characteristics, which can be utilised in agriculture as well as for soil remediation. Valorising food waste into biofertilisers and soil amendments has great potential to combat land degradation in agricultural areas. Biofertilisers are rich in nutrients that can reduce the dependability of using conventional mineral fertilisers. Food waste products, unlike mineral fertilisers, can also be used as soil amendments to improve productivity. These characteristics of food wastes assist in the remediation of contaminated soils. This paper reviews the volume of food waste within the food chain and types of food waste feedstocks that can be valorised into various products, including the conversion methods. Unintended consequences of the utilisation of food waste as biofertilisers and soil-amendment products resulting from their relatively low concentrations of trace element nutrients and presence of potentially toxic elements are also evaluated.", "qas": [{"id": "13028", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "production", "answer_start": 342}, {"text": "products", "answer_start": 467}, {"text": "fossil-derived products", "answer_start": 627}, {"text": "soil amendments", "answer_start": 888}, {"text": "food waste products", "answer_start": 1007}, {"text": "biochar production", "answer_start": 1124}, {"text": "soil remediation", "answer_start": 1252}, {"text": "Food waste products", "answer_start": 1516}, {"text": "productivity", "answer_start": 1612}, {"text": "contaminated soils", "answer_start": 1692}, {"text": "soil-amendment products", "answer_start": 1971}]}]}, {"context": "The beginning of 2021 was marked by COVID-19 vaccination campaigns worldwide.

A base bitumen was modified with styrene butadiene styrene (SBS), crumb rubber (CR), ethylene\u2013vinyl acetate (EVA) and various polyethylene to study the effects of these modifiers on the rheological behaviour of hybrid polymer-modified bitumen (PMB).

This behaviour is reported in most of the reviewed literature, regardless of the plastic type, percentage of addition, pretreatment methods, and experimental parameters employed. We employed Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Network to develop predictive models to predict the effect of plastic addition and mixing condition on the modified bitumen\u2019s penetration, softening point and viscosity properties. The models had excellent prediction ability and can help engineers optimise the plastic modified bitumen properties. Furthermore, we reviewed the effect of plastic addition on the bitumen\u2019s Superpave properties and found that the majority of the studies showed improvement on the bitumen resistance to hot temperature, but only a small percentage exhibited an enhancement in the cold cracking resistance. Among the drawbacks, the addition of plastic waste tends to deteriorate the workability of the bitumen by increasing its viscosity and by provoking a phase separation behaviour. This study also compiled a summary graph showing the recommended percentages of the different plastic types to be added to bitumen based on the reviewed literature. An addition of 4.5% plastic waste over bitumen weight seems to be the most effective. In conclusion, it is recommended to use plastic waste in bitumens that are intended to be implemented at moderate and hot climates. However, the addition should be limited to less than 5%, so it does not deteriorate the workability of the bitumen.", "qas": [{"id": "13070", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "bitumen properties", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "bitumen", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "modified bitumen\u2019s penetration", "answer_start": 1075}, {"text": "plastic modified bitumen properties", "answer_start": 1229}, {"text": "bitumen\u2019s Superpave properties", "answer_start": 1329}, {"text": "bitumen resistance", "answer_start": 1429}, {"text": "bitumen weight", "answer_start": 1936}, {"text": "bitumens", "answer_start": 2040}]}]}, {"context": "The distribution of biomass pyrolysis products under high pressure have rarely been reported.

A model plastic waste collected from a seaport was waste buoy (WB), which has been widely used in fishing industry. Prior to the pyrolysis tests, the exact type of plastic in WB and the thermolytic characteristics of WB were examined. Since the WB was made of polystyrene, it was mainly converted into styrene monomer (styrene), dimer (diphenyl-1-butene), and trimer (2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene) from pyrolysis of WB. To further valorize/detoxify styrene derivatives into value-added syngas, catalytic pyrolysis of WB was practiced using the Ni-based catalysts (2/5/10 wt% Ni/SiO2). The yield of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis process of WB was more than one magnitude higher comparing to that from the non-catalytic one. H2 formation also increased as catalyst loading increased. When flow gas was switched from inert gas to CO2, CO gas formation was enhanced due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and styrene derivatives over Ni catalysts. Syngas (H2/CO) formation under the CO2 condition was 5 times higher in comparison to the N2 condition in catalytic pyrolyses of WB with 10 wt% Ni/SiO2.

High discrimination rates were obtained despite the heterogeneity among samples especially differences in colors, thicknesses and surface textures. The reproducibility of the proposed approach was also tested using two spectrometers with considerable differences in their sensitivities. Discrimination rates were not affected proving that the developed approach could be extrapolated to different spectrometers.

The results from the pyrolysis tests demonstrated that CO and CO2 are the main produced gases during the pyrolysis of the finer fraction of landfill waste. This might be caused by the accumulation of degraded organic materials. The oil products from the pyrolysis of landfill waste were dominated by the derivative products of plastics such as styrene, toluene, and ethylbenzene. The chars obtained from the pyrolysis process were gasified under steam and steam/air atmospheres at temperatures between 800 and 900\u202f\u00b0C by using thermogravimetry. The results from the gasification tests demonstrated that the char reactivity was mainly affected by the amount ratio between catalytic elements (K, Ca, Na, Mg, and Fe) over the inhibitor elements (Si, Al, and Cl), as well as the ash amount in the char. The results showed that char from the fine fraction of landfill waste has a higher reactivity than the RDF fraction, due to the high content of catalytic metal elements. These results suggest the use of a smaller sieve opening size for landfill waste separation processes may produce waste fuels with a high reactivity during gasification.

SCW has been extensively used in the last 15years to perform hydrolysis reactions. We propose to discuss in this book chapter the main fields of the application of the SCW hydrolysis reactions: (1) biomass liquefaction toward biofuels and platform molecules and (2) material recycling.               SCW has been identified as an efficient medium in the transformation of biomass. Actually, Supercritical Biomass Valorization is a new generation of SCW-based technology, following the R&D development performed in SCW Oxidation. Two main routes can be investigated: the SuperCritical Biomass Gasification process and the SuperCritical Biomass Liquefaction process. Moreover, at present, the increase in the plant sourcing in the chemical industry is inescapable because of the social request for low environmental impact products and the high prices of products from fossil resources. In this context, biomass is particularly interesting because it is abundant and can be easily mobilized. Since lignocellulosic materials constitute approximately 95% of the total plant biomass, the discovery and the investigation of novel and effective pathways for their conversion are very important. In this chapter, we will present the direct SCW liquefaction of this new resource of carbon in order to produce two types of \u201cbiobased\u201d products: 2G biofuels and platform molecules.               In the context of a sustainable society, material recycling has an important role to play. Nowadays, the industry cannot produce consumer goods or industrial products without thinking about the future of each product in an environment and energetic point of view. Therefore in the field of environmentally friendly processes, a major challenge is the recycling of man-made materials. SCW has also been identified as an interesting medium for this aim. In this chapter, we will present two major aspects of material recycling using SCW: recycling of plastics and composite materials. We will see that hydrolysis reactions can be completed with alcoholysis reactions using near- and supercritical alcohols.

The plastic aggregates increase the cement mortar's ability to deform on stress application, delaying failure and turning the typical brittle failure of cement mortars into a ductile failure, a notable asset for those specifying repair mortars for masonry which typically deforms over time. The fall in the mechanical/hygric properties and density caused by the plastic (>15% content), is mainly due to the proliferation of disrupted interfaces rather than to the physical properties of the plastics themselves. There is not significant direct correlation between the properties of the mortars and those of their plastic aggregates \u2013 except for the compressive strength.

One of the most critical concerns that experts have been examining and searching for creative answers to is pollution and its direct and indirect detrimental effects on humans and animals.

In the case of rubber waste, energy recovery and recycling are the two more widely used methods while prevention still needs to be developed. Recent progresses in organic and polymer chemistry offer new possibilities that may help to improve the end-of-life management of rubbers. Classical recycling methods consist in breaking more or less indifferently bridges and chains, impeding the elastomeric properties of recycled materials. New strategies deal with the design of dynamic bridges making the resulting rubber recyclable and even self-healing in some cases. Playing with the chemistry of rubbers thus appears as a \u201cCradle to Cradle\u201d approach to get recyclability and prevention of rubber waste. Thermoplastic elastomers, recyclable owing to physical cross-links (supramolecular interactions as phase-separated or crystallized bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, fillers) are insufficiently heat- or solvent-resistant. Reversible covalent chemistry as Diels-Alder reaction or better, exchangeable covalent chemistry (vitrimers, transesterification in particular) combine recyclability and solvent insolubility, but often fail in providing elastomers with high mechanical properties.

The main advantage of this method is that kinetic interpretation is straightforward and unique because chemical reactions are not coupled with heat and mass transfer processes. Due to the fast heating, the initial structure of the polymer is not modified and therefore the results relate to the initial chemical structure and intrinsic rate. The following properties were determined in real time: mass, diameter, density, optical properties, and temperature. From mass loss rate versus inverse temperature, and activation energy of 103.1 kJ/mol was determined. This value is in the low spectrum of activation energies measured by other methods. From the behavior of the squared diameter with time, it was found that pyrolysis obeyed a d 2 law. Density was found to remain constant with extent of reaction, indicative of a non-charring process. The novelty of this study is the ability to determine the absorption coefficient of the particle (from the photophoretic force measured in this study). This enabled a look into the condensed phase during reaction, in real time. The absorption coefficient did not change during the first 8% of conversion, then it increased gradually with conversion. Since the absorption coefficient is directly related to the chemical structure and extent of cross-linking, constancy indicates that pyrolysis occurred without changes in the chemical structure.

This leads to the formation of plastic fragments, which are considered as micro and nano plastics when their size is <5 mm and < 10 nm. In recent years, plastic pollution has been reported in all kinds of environments worldwide and is considered a threat to the health of the ecosystem and humans. Besides, plastics serve as vectors for pollutants as they are capable of adsorbing and accumulating pollutants from seawater. However, this particular ability exposes the tendency of exploiting plastic waste as an adsorbent for removing pollutants from polluted water. Considering the problems caused by plastic waste to ecosystems, this concept is very interesting and attractive as a way to protect the environment by recycling or reusing plastic wastes as novel low-cost adsorbents. Meanwhile, studies have begun to exploit and understand the concept of using plastic waste as an adsorbent to remove diverse pollutants such as heavy and radioactive metals, persistent organic pollutants, dyes and oils from aqueous solutions as well as gases e.g volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H 2 ). This paper, therefore, provides an overview of studies, highlighting the process of adsorbent preparation, plastic/pollutant interaction mechanisms (including kinetic and isotherm models), and factors influencing the removal rates and desorption of pollutants and reusability of the plastic-based adsorbent. Diverse pollutants such as heavy and radioactive metals, persistent organic pollutants, dyes and oils from aqueous solutions as well as gases e.g volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H 2 ) have been removed by plastic based adsorbent with the modified ones showing higher removal capacity. Desorption and reusability studies have shown that the plastic-based adsorbent is re-generable and stable for dyes and heavy metals (e.g. Pb 2 + ) with high desorption rate (> 80 %) while for low (< 40 %) for phenathrene. Applying plastic waste is a novel potential way of pollutant removal from the environment and therefore a facile sustainable approach. However, the optimization of the method considering the factors affecting the removal rate as well as characterizing the plastic absorbents before and after pollutant adsorption should be conducted. This will help in understanding the possibility of using this concept for field applications.", "qas": [{"id": "13273", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "oils", "answer_start": 1169}]}]}, {"context": "The aim of this study is to analyze the exergetic, environmental, and economic impact of the use of alternative fuels (Plasmix), instead of coal on the clinker production to valorise a non-recyclable waste and to limit global CO2 emissions.

In Australia, over 1.3 million tons of packaging glass is consumed per annum. Each year only around 40% of the used glass in this pool is recovered nationally via a complex system of collection, sorting and re-processing. Thus there is a significant opportunity to recover this waste stream further. Throughout the glass recovery process, glass packaging is progressively broken into ever smaller pieces, to eventually form what is known as Glass Fines. Glass Fines are a hard waste to sort and the lowest value in the mixed waste stream due to their size, colour mix, and the range of non-glass contaminates that are additionally a part of the recovery system. Despite the high value the public holds for glass recycling, Glass Fines are in fact a by-product of a recovery process that enables the systemic degradation of an otherwise perfectly recyclable material. This research presents a review, designed to demonstrate ways that Glass Fines can be repurposed, recycled more effectively, or up-cycled.

This treaty mandates that parties who have signed must take administrative and legislative actions to prevent the environmental impacts that POPs pose, both within their jurisdictions and in the global environment. The specific BFRs listed in the Stockholm Convention are Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and Hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), chemicals which must therefore be heavily restricted within the jurisdictions of the signatories. As an example, within the EU, hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), the PBDE commercial mixtures, and HBCDD are almost entirely prohibited in terms of both production and use in commercial goods. Waste articles containing excess concentrations of these BFRs are similarly restricted and must be disposed of in a manner that destroys or irreversible transforms the BFR in question. In some cases, specific exemptions for these limits are defined by the Convention for certain parties: for example, Penta- and Octa-BDE can be present in waste materials for recycling until 2030, while Deca-BDE can be applied to some aviation and automotive applications until 2036. However, in such cases, very specific criteria and guidelines apply for their use and/or production. Worldwide, China, Japan, India, and the United States of America have made significant advances in the regulation of POPs, in line with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention. China has established concentration limits for Penta- and Octa-BDEs in electronic goods. It is also currently availing of an exemption to allow for the use of HBCDD and has not yet ratified the Convention with regards to Deca-BDE. Japan meanwhile has classified HBB and Penta-/Octa-BDE compounds as Class I Specified Chemical Substances which virtually prohibits the manufacture, import, and use of these chemicals in all applications. India has banned the manufacture, trade, import, and use of HBB, HBCDD and some PBDEs, and has established concentration limits for all PBDEs in certain electrical goods. Finally, the United States has no federal mandate for the restriction of POPs and has not ratified the annexes to the Convention requiring them to do so. However, thirteen states have implemented their own state-wide concentration limits on a variety of flame retarding chemicals in various commercial applications. Though these limits worldwide are a very positive step for the removal of POP-BFRs from the environment, the increased use of replacement flame retardants renders such legislation only partially effective. The lack of effective screening mechanisms in waste management facilities means that BFR-treated plastics can be inadvertently recycled and remain in circulation. The rise in the use of novel BFRs (NBFRs) can furthermore hinder screening methods currently being developed and the additives themselves may pose similar issues to their predecessors owing to their similar chemical properties.

The mechanical and thermal properties of these composites which have low concentrations of fibers were investigated. It was found that the number of extrusions had no effect on the thermal stability of composites, even if the presence of fibers may be accelerating the degradation of the polymer matrix. Moreover, rheological measurements showed a decrease in the viscosity of the neat matrix, while the opposite was observed in composites for which the highest viscosity is obtained after five cycles of extrusion. These results suggest a decrease in the molecular weight of the HDPE during reprocessing. For composites, however, a good dispersion of the RF matrix was obtained, which increased as the number of extrusions grew larger. As for the mechanical properties, a substantial enhancement in ductility was observed, as compared to that of neat recycled matrices, when small RF concentrations were added. Thus, for 2.6% RF the best enhancement of ductility was obtained with the conservation of the fiber length and a good dispersion of fibers.

Furthermore, dynamic covalent bonds and supramolecular interactions can provide \u2018living\u2019 functions to elastomers, such as self-healing and stimuli-responsiveness. These properties can be further enhanced by the addition of nanofillers with tailored surface chemistry to provide a dual role as a dynamic crosslinker and reinforcing element. To create reprocessable and recyclable elastomers, the coupling of multiple dynamic interactions provides unlimited possibilities to optimise the structure and properties of recyclable rubbers. Here we critically overview the applications of dynamic chemistry in rubbers, with a focus on macromolecular design and strategies to balance the mechanical, functional (e.g. self-healing) and reprocessing properties.", "qas": [{"id": "13336", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "Conventional rubber products", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "products", "answer_start": 20}]}]}, {"context": "The total hydrocarbon distribution of oil products from the pyrolysis of 4 mixtures of polyethylene-polystyrene waste has been studied by multidimensional chromatography (high performance liquid chromatography followed by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

The market and demand are continuously growing as the development of new biopolymers, applications and products are emerging. The objective of the review work reported in this chapter is to provide recent advances and challenges in the utilization of agricultural waste (agro-waste) or by-products in the production of bioplastics; namely polylactic acid, thermoplastics starch and chitosan bioplastic. Various agro waste that has potential to be used as bioplastics are bagasse, corn cob, cellulose, sago pith waste and chitin. The trend of agro-waste as the source for bioplastics production is rising due to the relatively lower cost and easily available. However, the utilization of agro-waste for development of bioplastics is still limited due to the unsystematic and low cost-effective waste management system, limited data on waste generation, and low production yield compared to food feedstock. It is believed that the prospect of agro-waste as feedstock for bioplastics will improve with the advancement in biotechnology and government intervention.

The study observed that aerobic biological treatment (e.g., lagoons, constructed wetlands) and physicochemical treatment (e.g., air stripping, coagulation, flocculation, etc.) are suitable to remove organic substances. While the above technologies have limitations in treating heavy metals and ammonia. On the other hand, adsorption and advanced oxidation are very effective in treating old leachate that contains heavy metals and NH3-N. But the process needs pretreatment and expensive chemicals supply, which is unsustainable. Advanced oxidation can efficiently remove COD, especially from matured leachates due to the complete degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. Still, it seems ineffective for young leachates with high organic pollutant loads. The review also identifies the cost for chemicals and energy needed to treat different leachates with each specific technology. Therefore, innovative techniques are required that will minimize energy consumption, sludge and toxin production, and recover organic, inorganic, xenobiotic compounds in a harmless phase and maximize their beneficial applications.", "qas": [{"id": "13446", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "energy", "answer_start": 1245}, {"text": "toxin production", "answer_start": 1415}, {"text": "energy consumption", "answer_start": 1384}]}]}, {"context": "In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to utilizing dedicated waste biomass as a sustainable, cheap, and abundant fuel and material source.

Furthermore, biomass can be utilized as a source of advanced carbon materials. Carbon materials derived from biomass can also be used to support catalysts in fuel cells with polymer electrolyte membranes.

Metal nanoparticle activation, doping, and dispersion are just a few of the methods that may be used to improve the performance of sensors. To detect a variety of target analytes, such as biomolecules, metal ions, contaminants, food additives, and flavonoids, some of the key or seminal advances in the field of biomass-derived carbonaceous compounds are discussed. The materials and composites made of biomass-derived carbon will be in-depth examined, evaluated, and compared in this review. The associated technological difficulties are also discussed, and future research areas are suggested for use in practical applications. Nano carbon materials have several integrated advantages, including good electrical conductivity, structural and chemical flexibility, reduced chemical functionalization, and bulk production potential, making them viable candidates for various electrochemical processes.

Investigated by advanced characterization and kinetic models, the fast kinetics and superior qdyn are attributed to (1) elevated external diffusion driven by the submicron particle size; (2) enhanced intraparticle diffusion caused by the developed mesoporous structure (Vmeso/Vmicro = 8.1); (3) numerous quaternary ammonium anion-exchange sites (840 \u00b5mol/g), and (4) appropriate adsorption affinity (0.031 L/\u00b5mol for PFOS, and 0.023 L/\u00b5mol for PFOA). Since the adsorption was proven to be a synergistic process of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, effective adsorption ([PFOX]ini = 1.21 \u00b5M, concentration levels of highly-contaminant-sites) was obtained at conventional natural water chemistries.

Because of their extremely low recyclability rate, plastic bags remain a significant source of land-based litter and marine debris and impair stormwater management systems. They also reduce the effectiveness of automated recycling systems. In response, local governments increasingly have adopted a variety of measures specifically intended to reduce the store-level consumption of single-use shopping bags in 5 major categories: bans, imposition of fees and taxes, establishing minimum product design of bags, requiring consumer education, and mandating retailer take-back programs.

For the fee-based ordinances, the mode is $0.10 per bag; every tax/fee ordinance allows retailers to retain some or all the collected fee.

Analysis of variance and a multiple comparison method (least significant difference) were used to compare mean weight and volume of waste generated in period 1 with data collected during periods 2 and 3. Results Mean waste generated per meal by weight and volume ranged from 0.93 to 1.00lb and 1.44 to 1.65 gal, respectively.

In this work, TPO was distilled at atmospheric pressure into different fractions (light, low-middle, high-middle, and heavy), and the structural characteristics of each fraction were explored. Therefore, advanced analytical techniques such as GC\u2013MS, APPI FT-ICR MS and 1H and 13C NMR were utilized. For the light fraction, the GC\u2013MS revealed a significant presence of benzene, toluene, and xylene, as well as limonene. From the APPI FT-ICR MS results, the low-middle, high-middle, and heavy fractions were classified into a number of molecular classes. Among these, pure hydrocarbons (HC), hydrocarbons containing one sulfur atom (S1), hydrocarbons containing two oxygen atoms (O2), etc. Here, HC and S1 were found to be the most abundant molecular classes in all fractions. Finally, a structural analysis of the functional groups present in each TPO fraction was conducted by 1H and 13C NMR.

The most common types of treatment used for livestock wastes are solids/liquid separation, anaerobic lagoons, composting and anaerobic digestion. The most common utilization practice is to apply manure to cropland, pasture, and hayland as a source of nutrients for plant growth and organic matter to improve soil tilth and water holding capacity.               The food processing industry has three possibilities for treating their wastewaters: (1) they may be treated separately in an industrial wastewater treatment plant; (2) raw wastewaters may be discharged to a municipal wastewater plant for complete treatment; or (3) the wastewater may be pretreated at the site prior to discharge to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Many food processing wastewaters have high concentrations of organics. Meat processing wastewaters may also have high concentrations of nitrogen, fat, grease and oil. Most food processing plants that discharge to municipal wastewater treatment plants use some form of pretreatment to reduce BOD, suspended solids, and fat, grease and oil concentrations. Pretreatment processes may include both physical and chemical processes, including screening, sedimentation, flotation and flocculation.

Through advanced recycling techniques, high-quality rubber shredders and other state-of-the-art equipment, used tires can be transformed into new useful materials. Instead of dumping waste tires in landfills or used as fuel in cement plants, these waste materials can be seen as a new material which once recycled can substitute virgin raw material.

Pyrolysis has advantages as all mixed plastics can be reduced back to petrochemicals. Fluidized beds have useful characteristics for energy recovery. They have an economic advantage in industrial operations due to low maintenance costs when compared to other reactors. Fluidizing beds provide flexibility in the operation that makes it possible to use various fluidizing agents and process conditions.

These policies have their origins in the Brundtland Report of 1987, which provides a platform for a more sustainable society. Biodegradable polymers are part of the emerging portfolio of renewable raw materials seeking to deliver environmental, social, and economic benefits. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are naturally-occurring biodegradable-polyesters accumulated by bacteria usually in response to inorganic nutrient limitation in the presence of excess carbon. Most of the early research into PHA accumulation and technology development for industrial-scale production was undertaken using virgin starting materials. For example, polyhydroxybutyrate and copolymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate are produced today at industrial scale from corn-derived glucose. However, in recent years, research has been undertaken to convert domestic and industrial wastes to PHA. These wastes in today\u2019s context are residuals seen by a growing body of stakeholders as platform resources for a biobased society. In the present review, we consider residuals from food, plastic, forest and lignocellulosic, and biodiesel manufacturing (glycerol). Thus, this review seeks to gain perspective of opportunities from literature reporting the production of PHA from carbon-rich residuals as feedstocks. A discussion on approaches and context for PHA production with reference to pure- and mixed-culture technologies is provided. Literature reports advocate results of the promise of waste conversion to PHA. However, the vast majority of studies on waste to PHA is at laboratory scale. The questions of surmounting the technical and political hurdles to industrialization are generally left unanswered. There are a limited number of studies that have progressed into fermentors and a dearth of pilot-scale demonstration. A number of fermentation studies show that biomass and PHA productivity can be increased, and sometimes dramatically, in a fermentor. The relevant application-specific properties of the polymers from the wastes studied and the effect of altered-waste composition on polymer properties are generally not well reported and would greatly benefit the progress of the research as high productivity is of limited value without the context of requisite case-specific polymer properties. The proposed use of a waste residual is advantageous from a life cycle viewpoint as it removes the direct or indirect effect of PHA production on land usage and food production. However, the question, of how economic drivers will promote or hinder advancements to demonstration scale, when wastes generally become understood as resources for a biobased society, hangs today in the balance due to a lack of shared vision and the legacy of mistakes made with first generation bioproducts.

Hence, this review presents two newly identified environmentally friendly approaches, plastic biodegradation and bioplastic production using algae, to solve the increased global plastic waste. Algae, particularly microalgae, can degrade the plastic materials through the toxins systems or enzymes synthesized by microalgae itself while using the plastic polymers as carbon sources. Utilizing algae for plastic biodegradation has been critically reviewed in this paper to demonstrate the mechanism and how microplastics affect the algae. On the other hand, algae-derived bioplastics have identical properties and characteristics as petroleum-based plastics, while remarkably being biodegradable in nature.

As thermal treatment and recycling are common disposal methods for BFR-laden objects, it is essential to precisely describe their decomposition chemistry at elevated temperatures pertinent to their thermal recycling. Laboratory-level and pilot-scale investigations have addressed the thermal decomposition of pure BFRs and/or BFR-laden polymers under oxidative and pyrolytic environments, typically at temperatures of 280\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C. These studies shed light on the effects of various factors influencing the decomposition behaviour of BFRs such as chemical character, polymer matrix, residence time, bromine input, oxygen concentration, and temperature. Although BFRs decomposition mainly occurs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to the overall decomposition of BFRs. Exposing BFRs to temperatures higher than their melting points results in evaporation. Quantum chemical calculations have served to provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the chemical phenomena operating in decomposition of BFRs and subsequent emissions of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste incineration, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade and form brominated products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Major BPICs comprise brominated benzenes and phenols in addition to a wide range of brominated aromatics. Pyrolytic versus oxidative conditions seems to have very little influence on the thermal stability and decomposition behaviour of commonly-deployed BFRs. Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to PBDD/Fs. Experimental studies have established inventories of PBDD/F emissions with alarming high yields for many BFRs. Co-combustion of BFRs-containing objects with a chlorine source (e.g. polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of significant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (i.e. PXDD/Fs). Formation of PBDD/Fs from incomplete BFRs decomposition occurs primarily due to the condensations of gas phase precursors, including unaltered structural entities of some BFRs in their own right. Complete destruction of BFRs promotes PBDD/Fs formation via de novo synthesis. Bromination of PBDD/Fs in gas phase reactions is more prevalent if compared with chlorination mechanisms of PCDD/Fs, which is largely dominated by heterogeneous pathways. In uncontrolled burning and in simulated fly ash experiments, a strong correlation between congeners patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBDD/Fs indicate that PBDEs function as direct precursors for PBDD/Fs, even in the de novo synthesis route. In this review, we critically discuss current literature on BFRs thermal decomposition mechanisms; gather information regarding the contribution of homogenous and heterogeneous routes to overall BFRs decomposition; survey all studies pertinent to the emission of PBDD/Fs and their analogous mixed halogenated counterparts from open burning of e-waste, and finally, highlight knowledge gaps and potential directions that warrant further investigations.", "qas": [{"id": "13782", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "brominated products", "answer_start": 1422}]}]}, {"context": "The generation of small fragments from the environmental ageing of microplastics (MPs) is still a poorly known process.

In nature, 99 wt.% of Re is associated with molybdenite minerals via the form of isomorphism, and the element abundance of Mo (about 1.1\u20131.5 ppm) and Re (about 0.0004\u20130.0026 ppm) is tremendous in the continental crust. These congenital characteristics make it difficult to separate Mo and Re. In this work, the Mo and Re resource features and products consumption are briefly summarized, and the pre-separation of Mo and Re from minerals or secondary alloy scraps, and the deep separation of the dissolved Mo and Re from solutions are systematically reviewed. Pyrometallurgy approaches are suitable for the treatment of high-grade Mo concentrates, however it lacks vast energy consumption and SO2 emission. Hydrometallurgical process is appropriate to deal with low-grade Mo concentrates, but leaching efficiency of Mo is low and numerous expensive oxidants are consumed. As for deep separation of Mo and Re from the solutions, selective chemical precipitation, ion exchange, and solvent extraction are commonly used in industry to separate Mo and Re. Due to separation efficiency, Mo and Re mixture solutions with low concentrations generally lower than 0.5 g/L are concomitantly generated after ion exchange and solvent extraction. Selective adsorption is a prospective method to separate Mo and Re from ultra-low concentration solutions, while the existing preparation technologies of high-selectivity adsorbents are characterized as complex and expensive.

Although many studies have focused on the fate, transport, ecotoxicity, and health risks of plastic waste contaminants, only a few studies have investigated microbial remediation of contaminants using cutting edge nanoscience. This review aims at addressing the environmental problems caused by micro-plastic (MP) and nano-plastic (NP) particles in the context of nanoscience (e.g., synthetic nanoparticle\u2013plastic integrated research), microbial ecology, and remediation technologies to help elucidate their environmental fate, behavior, transport, eco-toxicity, and management. Interactions between plastic and microbes generally cause biofilm formation, which has biological effects that range from genes (by influencing horizontal gene transfer) to whole ecosystems (by influencing biogeochemical cycling, carbon (C) sequestration, and climate). Plastic waste remediation via chemical and bio-nanotechnologies (e.g., coagulation, membrane bioreactors, biodegradation, and phytoremediation) are also reviewed. In this respect, thermochemical conversion of plastic waste into energy is a promising management option.

Current methods to tackle the problem are inadequate and those that work are costly. However, AMD contain the rare earth elements (REEs) which remain very important due to the growing increase in their demand because of their critical and indispensable use in many high-tech industries today. The growing demand of the REEs should be met by an increase in supply. The recovery of REEs from AMD is an important development that would cushion REEs supply challenges, thus requires significant consideration. There are several techniques that have been used to recover metal ions from wastewater including AMD. This paper gives a review of typical treatment techniques, innovative developments and examples of the various technologies used for the recovery of REEs from different process solutions, which could be applied in the recovery of REEs from AMD. These techniques include chemical precipitation, solvent extraction, cloud point extraction, ion flotation, ion-exchange, adsorption, molecular recognition technology, magnetic separation and membrane filtration . It is clear from the literature surveyed that chemical precipitation, solvent extraction, ion-exchange and adsorption are the most studied techniques for the recovery of REEs from solutions. Precipitation, ion flotation and adsorption processes show significant potential in their application to recover REEs from AMD. However, the complex AMD chemistry with high concentration of heavy metals require development of integrated process flowsheets incorporating the removal of heavy metals prior to precipitation, ion flotation or adsorption to increase the purity of the REE product stream. On the other hand, these flowsheets should be developed with economic feasibility considerations. Whereas solvent extraction is the preferred method for recovery of rare-earth ions from concentrated aqueous waste streams and pregnant leaching solutions, this method is not recommended for removal of rare-earth ions from diluted aqueous waste streams such as AMD because of the unavoidable contamination of the aqueous phase by organic solvents. Ion-exchange resins and chelating resins also show potential. However, despite ion-exchange being a cheap process, the slow kinetics, large volumes of AMD and the potential of resin poisoning from the impurities in AMD make the process challenging. This necessitates research into developing IX resin suitable for AMD chemistry. In addition, there is recognized prospect of the application of magnetic separation, ionic liquids and cloud point extraction in the recovery of REEs from dilute solutions, although these technologies have not been tested in treating huge volumes of process solutions.", "qas": [{"id": "13800", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "REE product stream", "answer_start": 1769}]}]}, {"context": "A software system for simulating processes for thermal treatment and/or incineration of various types of wastes has been developed.

Tire pyrolytic oil was produced from waste tires with vacuum pyrolysis technique. Hydro-sulfuric acid treatment, vacuum distillation and oxidative desulfurization processes were applied to reduce emission values of tire pyrolytic oil. Tire pyrolytic oil was blended with neat diesel as 10 vol% (TPO10D90), 30 vol% (TPO30D70) and 50 vol% (TPO50D50).

The abundance of microplastics in fresh water also poses direct threat to urban water quality. Since the 1950s, approximately 1 billion tons of plastic have been disposed of and currently about 280 million tons of plastic are generated every year, of which more than 10% eventually enters the aquatic ecosystems. The plastic has become a topic of focus for the scientific community because of its ability to persist in the environment for a longer period, which helps it to distribute widely from their source and accumulate in the aquatic ecosystems. Synthetic polymers such as fragments, fiber, pellet, film, bead, or foam ranging from 100\u03bcm to 5mm in size are called microplastics (MPs). The microplastics are formed via mechanical/biological fragmentation of larger plastic debris. The main cause of MPs in the global waters can be attributed to the mismanagement of wastes generated by solid and liquid products. Consequently, microplastics become ubiquitously available in aquatic ecosystems, and inflict physical damage and compromise feeding behavior of aquatic biota. Thus, it has become highly desirable to comprehend the techniques that are largely used for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of these polymeric contaminants in aquatic environments.

The relationship observed between plastic consumption and the gross domestic product for several countries was used to estimate future plastics consumption (master curve). Elasticities of the individual material growth with respect to GDP were established for the past and for the next three decades estimated for India thereby assuming a development comparable with that of Western Europe. On this basis, the total plastics consumption is projected to grow by a factor of 6 between 2000 and 2030. The consumption of various end products is combined with their corresponding lifetimes to calculate the total waste quantities. The weighted average lifetime of plastics products was calculated as 8 years.

In an attempt to mitigate pollution caused by the excess PPE waste, an innovative way was developed in this research to reduce pandemic-generated wastes by using the shredded face mask (SFM) fibers as an additive to hot mix asphalt (HMA) to enhance rutting resistance.

Since the SFM behaves as a semi-liquid between 115.5 and 160 \u00b0C, which is in the range of HMA mixing and paving temperature, it can function as a binding agent to glue the aggregates. When the pavement is cooled down to ambient temperature, the hardened SFM can provide stability and stiffness to HMA.

Large-scale production and applications of plastics increase their possibility of entering the environment. Previous environmental impact studies typically focused on the toxicity, behavior and fate; limited attention was paid on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. With the increase of plastic waste, the threat of plastic pollution to the earth\u2019s climate has been gradually taken seriously. Evidence showed that greenhouse gas emissions occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, including extraction and transportation of plastic raw materials, plastic manufacturing, waste treatment and entering the environment. The oil and gas industries used to make plastics are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions (from the extraction of raw materials to the manufacture of plastics). Emissions of greenhouse gases during manufacture are mainly controlled by the production facilities themselves, usually depending on the efficiency, configuration and service life of equipment. Additionally, there are some unintended impacts, including transport requirements, pipeline leakage, land use, as well as impeding forests as natural carbons sinks. Recycling of plastic waste energy seems to be a good way to deal with waste plastics, but this process will release a lot of greenhouse gases. With this energy conversion occurring, the incineration of plastic packing waste will become one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, plastics released into the environment also slowly release greenhouse gases, and the presence of (micro)plastics in the ocean will seriously interfere with the carbon fixation capacity of the ocean. In its current form, greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics will reach 1.34 gigatons per year by 2030 and 2.8 gigatons per year by 2050. This will seriously consume the global remaining carbon budgets, thereby threatening the ability of the global community to keep global temperatures rising by below 1.5 \u00b0C even 2 \u00b0C by 2100. In order to achieve this goal, the total global greenhouse gas emissions must be kept within the remaining carbon budget of 420\u2013570 gigatons. The accumulative greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics may exceed 56 gigatons by 2050 (approximately accounting for 10%\u201313% of the total remaining carbon budget).

However, there are significant challenges and uncertainties in this estimation, and challenge and uncertainty factors come from all aspects. Recently, several organizations and researchers have started to discern the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and plastic industrials, but relevant research on these impacts is still in its infancy. Consequently, the contribution of plastic pollution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be given immediate attention and it needs to further explore the impact of plastic pollution on greenhouse gas emission and climate change.

The bromine concentration in plastics is very heterogeneous, found in high concentrations in large household appliance (LHA) plastics, and also found in unexpected product categories, as observed by other authors. Clearly, an unwanted global loop of brominated substances occurs via the international recycling of plastic scrap. In waste (n=65), polybromobiphenyls, polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane were analysed. The most concentrated BFRs are decaBDE (3000\u202fmg/kg) and TBBPA (8000\u202fmg/kg). The bromine concentration of regulated brominated substances was identified in 2014 and 2015 to be up to 86% of total bromine in \u201cold\u201d waste (SHA, CRT), 30\u201350% in \u201cyounger\u201d waste (Flat screens), and a mean of only 8% in recent products (2009\u20132013). Regulated substances are a minority of all the brominated substances and the only practical way to sort is to measure total bromine on-line. The sorting reduces the mean bromine concentration in the \u201cLow Br\u201d fraction in all sites, and reduces the decaBDE concentration to levels below the restricted use limit. After sorting, the concentration in the \u201cHigh Br\u201d fractions exceeds all present or future regulatory limits. In conclusion, sorting of small household appliances, cathode ray tubes and flat screen plastics is necessary to avoid uncontrolled dispersion of regulated substances in recycled raw material. Other categories (large household appliances, electric and electronic tools, lighting equipment) should also be considered, since their total bromine content (unweighted mean concentration) is high for some of these products. A European campaign consisting of 7 countries and 35 sites will begin in 2017, directed by WEEE Forum, the European association speaking for thirty-one not-for-profit e-waste producer responsibility organisations, to assess the mean bromine content of plastics from large household appliances after shredding.", "qas": [{"id": "13876", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the products formed?", "answers": [{"text": "product regulation", "answer_start": 440}, {"text": "unexpected product categories", "answer_start": 1316}, {"text": "recent products", "answer_start": 1929}, {"text": "products", "answer_start": 1936}]}]}, {"context": "Microplastics (MPs) pollution has gained a lot of global interests due to its toxicity to the surrounding ecosystems.

Fragments were identified as the highest abundance type of MPs, followed by fiber, foam and pellet. MPs of size of <1 mm were predominantly present in the samples. Varieties of colors were distinguished in which transparent or no color MPs were the highest quantity studied in the samples. Polymers identified were mainly polyethylene (PE), polyester (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP), derived from primary and secondary MPs. Carbon and oxygen were dominant and have the highest concentration identified with other elements such as Ca, Al, Ti and Cl. The primary use of these elements as additives are associated with the manufacturing process as they are used to enhance the quality during plastic production.

Results showed that salt types and ionic strength had significant effects on the stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics, while pH had none.

It implies that CaCl2 destabilized both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics more aggressively than NaCl and MgCl2. Moreover, polystyrene nanospheres are more stable in the aquatic environment than polyethylene nanoscale plastics.

However, current commercial usage of refined vegetable oils for biodiesel production is impractical and uneconomical due to high feedstock cost and priority as food resources. Low-grade oil, typically waste cooking oil can be a better alternative; however, the high free fatty acids (FFA) content in waste cooking oil has become the main drawback for this potential feedstock. Therefore, this review paper is aimed to give an overview on the current status of biodiesel production and the potential of waste cooking oil as an alternative feedstock. Advantages and limitations of using homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic transesterification on oil with high FFA (mostly waste cooking oil) are discussed in detail. It was found that using heterogeneous acid catalyst and enzyme are the best option to produce biodiesel from oil with high FFA as compared to the current commercial homogeneous base-catalyzed process. However, these heterogeneous acid and enzyme catalyze system still suffers from serious mass transfer limitation problems and therefore are not favorable for industrial application. Nevertheless, towards the end of this review paper, a few latest technological developments that have the potential to overcome the mass transfer limitation problem such as oscillatory flow reactor (OFR), ultrasonication, microwave reactor and co-solvent are reviewed.

In this paper the feasibility of replacing paper fibre with waste cereal straw fibre is examined. The aim was to produce materials that could be used to form flat, round trays, such as those used in supporting shrink wrapped food items. The material was required to have properties that matched existing alternatives, such as expanded polystyrene, in terms of physical and mechanical characteristics but with an enhanced level of biodegradability. The data showed that the pulp moulded material containing up to 80% straw performed significantly better compared to expanded polystyrene in tensile properties (modulus of 0.47MPa for an 80% straw mix compared to 0.16MPa for EPS). Modulus under bending was shown to be lower for straw based materials compared to EPS (0.015MPa compare to 0.035MPa). Adjustments in product thickness allowed performance parameters to be met. Wet end addition of chemicals was successfully used to provide water resistance without affecting other variables.
