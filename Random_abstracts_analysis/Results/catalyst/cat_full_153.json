[{"context": "Discarded plastics can be converted to various fuels and chemicals to generate positive economic value instead of polluting the environment. In the past few years, pyrolysis has attracted much attention in the industrial and scientific communities as a promising versatile platform to convert plastic waste into valuable resources. However, it is still difficult to fine-tune an efficient and selective pyrolysis process to narrow the product distribution for a feasible commercial production. Furthermore, traditional plastic-to-fuels technology looks like another expensive way to burn fossil fuels, making no contribution to the plastic circular economy. By learning from the developed plastic-to-fuels technology, achieving the conversion of plastic waste into naphtha or plastic monomers that can be used for new plastic manufacturing in a closed-loop way is a more promising resource recovery pathway. However, there is no comprehensive review so far about achieving plastic waste recycling/upcycling by pyrolysis. This article will provide a critical review about the recovery pathways of plastic pyrolysis based on the various products (fuels, naphtha, hydrogen, and light olefins). It will overview the recent advances regarding plastic pyrolysis process and reactor design, introduce various recovery pathways based on the pyrolysis process, summarize process optimization and catalyst development, discuss the present challenges for plastic pyrolysis, highlight the importance and significance of creating a plastics\u2019 circular economy, discuss the economic feasibility, the environmental impact, and outlook for future development for plastic pyrolysis. This review presents useful information to further develop and design an advanced pyrolysis process, with an improved efficiency, desirable product selectivity, and minimum environmental impacts. It is helpful to encourage more circular economy-oriented research aimed at converting waste plastics to naphtha and plastic monomers instead of simply producing fuels from the scientific communities of chemistry, energy, and the environment.", "qas": [{"id": "1", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "naphtha", "answer_start": 765}]}]}, {"context": "Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of two waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) fractions, with two different copper contents (low- and medium-grade WEEE named as LGE and MGE, respectively), were performed using micro- and lab-scale pyrolyzers.

WPEPBs could be converted into two parts by the SWA process: oil and solid residue. More than 80 % of the oil was identified as long-chain alkanes and alkenes due to the decomposition of polyethylene (PE) contained in WPEPBs. The presence of NH3 in SWA was beneficial to improve the production of long-chain alkenes. The plasticizers in WPEPBs including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalate ester (DEHP) could be efficiently converted into aniline (\u224815%) and 2-ethylhexanol (\u22484 %) due to the high reactivity of NH3 in the SWA process.

However, the relationship between the structure and activity of DESs is still ambiguous. Herein, we report an efficient 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/zinc acetate (HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2) DES catalyst for recycling waste PET based on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. First, the HTBD-OAc/ Zn(OAc)2 DES structure, in which the HTBD-OAc moiety and Zn(OAc)2 were connected through a N-H---O hydrogen bonding interaction, was clearly determined through theoretical calculations and experimental verification. Then, the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 was found to be effective for waste PET glycolysis, where the PET conversion reached 100%, and the bis(hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield reached 88.5% at 190 \u00b0C within 40 min in atmosphere. Additionally, the catalyst had high reuse performance; BHET yield remained 84.6% after the catalyst was used for over seven cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the PET glycolysis reaction mediated by the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 DES included two stages, and the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation (HTBD) played a crucial role. In the first stage, the active species [Zn]-OCH2CH2OH anion was generated through proton transfer from HTBD to OAc-, which was followed by HOCH2CH2O-H bond activation through the cooperation of HTBD and Zn. In the second stage, catalytic depolymerization of PET occurred through the cooperative functions of the Zn center and HOCH2CH2O- anion ligand.", "qas": [{"id": "40", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the materials used as catalyst?", "answers": [{"text": "Zn", "answer_start": 405}, {"text": "HTBD-OAc/Zn", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "/Zn", "answer_start": 404}]}]}, {"context": "Plastic waste has been identified as a potent feedstock for liquefaction to produce hydrocarbon liquid oil (HC-Oil) by employing Catalytic Thermo Liquefaction (CTL).

These properties make its disposal problematic, as items made from PVC retain their form for decades. The objective of this study is to provide an effective waste management method for the degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high-value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron(III) chloride. The iron(III)-tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono- and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton-type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites (sulfonated groups) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon-to-sulphur atom (C/S) ratio can vary from 8:1 to 29:1. The degradation efficiency, which is typically defined in terms of the bulk mass of the treated PVC plastics, was found to be greater than 98% in all cases.
