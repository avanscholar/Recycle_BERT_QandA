Owing to its unique structure and properties, graphene has opened new opportunities for the future systems and devices, which has led to increase its demand in numerous applications. However, scaling up its production is still a challenging job. Although there is a huge body of literature on the graphene synthesis using various techniques but eco-friendly and cost\u2013effective processes for mass scale production are still needed. In order to conceptualize and develop the processes fulfilling the growing concerns, it is important to overview the existing literature. The current review summarizes the production of graphene using several approaches as well as the potential of various waste materials as graphene precursors. The methods used for graphene synthesis have been categorized into top down techniques such as chemical exfoliation, mechanical exfoliation and chemical fabrication processes, and bottom up techniques including pyrolysis, plasma synthesis, epitaxial growth and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. Conversely, several limitations are considerate for an individual procedure such as toxicity of chemicals, high-cost, time consumption or inadequate quality of the product. Furthermore, mass production of graphene derivatives under low-cost can also be considered by utilizing a variety of wastes precursors such as plastic and batteries waste, newspaper, biomass, chitosan, coal, insects waste etc. This review designates the current advances in wastes-derived graphene synthesis to relief synthetic difficulties as well as predicts the future development in this area.", "qas": [{"id": "6282", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "pyrolysis", "answer_start": 1123}]}]}, {"context": "Natural rubber (NR) 1 1 NR: natural rubber is a biopolymer mainly composed of isoprene units linked to form double bonds with cis configuration.

Recovery and recycling of PSW can be categorized by four main routes, i.e. re-extrusion, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery. Re-extrusion (primary recycling) utilizes scrap plastics by re-introducing the reminder of certain extruded thermoplastics (mainly poly-\u03b1-olefins) into heat cycles within a processing line. When plastic articles are discarded after a number of life cycles, mechanical recycling techniques present themselves as a candidate for utilizing a percentage of the waste as recyclate and/or fillers. Collectively, all technologies that convert polymers to either monomers (monomer recycling) or petrochemicals (feedstock recycling) are referred to as chemical recycling. The technology behind its success is the depolymerization processes (e.g. thermolysis) that can result in a very profitable and sustainable industrial scheme, providing a high product yield and a minimal waste.

This can be minimized by screening potential PHAs producing strains, selecting inexpensive raw material, optimized cultivation condition and by adopting efficient recovery and purification strategies. Scope and approach The PHA upstream processing is expensive and contributes approximately 40% of total production cost. This can be minimized to greater extent by using inexpensive raw materials such as agro-industrial waste and lignocellulose waste (LCW).

Hydrothermal processing of lignocellulosic materials causes a variety of effects including extractive removal, hemicellulose hydrolysis and alteration of the properties of both cellulose and lignin.

The outcome of this review revealed that the interaction mechanisms by which the synergistic effect may occur are the transfer of active hydrogen radicals from plastic to the biomass unstable oxygenated radicals, the catalytic activity of the alkali/alkaline earth metal species in biomass, and the heat and mass transfer during the co-conversion. Biomass pre-treatment, the use of catalysts, and the similarity between the chemical structure of the biomass and the plastic used can strengthen the interactions.

Pyrolysis of FNW was conducted to produce value-added syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) in both CO2 and N2 environments with a variety of pyrolysis setups. The pyrolysis temperature significantly contributed to the thermal cracking of long-chain liquid HCs into H2 and C1-2 HCs under the N2 and CO2 conditions. In the presence of cobalt-based catalysts, an additional improvement of the reaction kinetics for producing H2 and C1-2 HCs was shown in the N2 environment. However, the synergistic effectiveness of Co-based catalysts and CO2 resulted in CO formation, because CO2 provided additional C and O sources over the Co-based catalysts. Thus, it allowed control of the H2/CO ratio in the CO2 and N2 atmospheres. The compositional matrix of the liquid HCs after pyrolysis also confirmed that CO2 controlled their aromaticity.

The interaction and rapid incorporation of CNF with the SF drastically improved the hydrophobicity of the surface by providing numerous micro and macroporous 3D cavities.

Desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as a major source of energy for transportation and industrialisation.

This limit is too high and can result in unnecessary emissions of carcinogenic benzene, PCBs and other pollutants. Both the natural raw materials and waste raw materials emit organic carbon. However, there is one major difference. The natural raw materials emit mostly aliphatic compounds at temperatures up to about 600 \u00b0C, whereas the organic compounds originating from waste-based raw material components can include hazardous pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which desorb in the preheater and are released into the environment. Therefore, waste raw materials such as soils contaminated with POPs or other semivolatile toxic chemicals cannot be introduced via the raw mill -(leading to desorption in the preheater) but need to be fed in the kiln inlet. Cement kilns treating POPs or raw materials with problematic semivolatile organics need strict control and possibly continuous monitoring for dioxins and other POPs.", "qas": [{"id": "6715", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "conversion", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "material conversion process", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "thermal", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "thermal decomposition", "answer_start": 245}]}]}, {"context": "The focus of this study is the pyrolysis and gasification of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and fine fractions recovered from the excavation of landfill waste, with an emphasize on the characterization of the reactivity and kinetics of the char-steam gasification.

The oil products from the pyrolysis of landfill waste were dominated by the derivative products of plastics such as styrene, toluene, and ethylbenzene.

The results from the gasification tests demonstrated that the char reactivity was mainly affected by the amount ratio between catalytic elements (K, Ca, Na, Mg, and Fe) over the inhibitor elements (Si, Al, and Cl), as well as the ash amount in the char. The results showed that char from the fine fraction of landfill waste has a higher reactivity than the RDF fraction, due to the high content of catalytic metal elements. These results suggest the use of a smaller sieve opening size for landfill waste separation processes may produce waste fuels with a high reactivity during gasification.

SCW has been identified as an efficient medium in the transformation of biomass. Actually, Supercritical Biomass Valorization is a new generation of SCW-based technology, following the R&D development performed in SCW Oxidation. Two main routes can be investigated: the SuperCritical Biomass Gasification process and the SuperCritical Biomass Liquefaction process. Moreover, at present, the increase in the plant sourcing in the chemical industry is inescapable because of the social request for low environmental impact products and the high prices of products from fossil resources. In this context, biomass is particularly interesting because it is abundant and can be easily mobilized. Since lignocellulosic materials constitute approximately 95% of the total plant biomass, the discovery and the investigation of novel and effective pathways for their conversion are very important. In this chapter, we will present the direct SCW liquefaction of this new resource of carbon in order to produce two types of \u201cbiobased\u201d products: 2G biofuels and platform molecules.

Nowadays, the industry cannot produce consumer goods or industrial products without thinking about the future of each product in an environment and energetic point of view. Therefore in the field of environmentally friendly processes, a major challenge is the recycling of man-made materials. SCW has also been identified as an interesting medium for this aim.

The main advantage of this method is that kinetic interpretation is straightforward and unique because chemical reactions are not coupled with heat and mass transfer processes. Due to the fast heating, the initial structure of the polymer is not modified and therefore the results relate to the initial chemical structure and intrinsic rate. The following properties were determined in real time: mass, diameter, density, optical properties, and temperature. From mass loss rate versus inverse temperature, and activation energy of 103.1 kJ/mol was determined. This value is in the low spectrum of activation energies measured by other methods.

This enabled a look into the condensed phase during reaction, in real time. The absorption coefficient did not change during the first 8% of conversion, then it increased gradually with conversion. Since the absorption coefficient is directly related to the chemical structure and extent of cross-linking, constancy indicates that pyrolysis occurred without changes in the chemical structure.

Thus there is a significant opportunity to recover this waste stream further. Throughout the glass recovery process, glass packaging is progressively broken into ever smaller pieces, to eventually form what is known as Glass Fines. Glass Fines are a hard waste to sort and the lowest value in the mixed waste stream due to their size, colour mix, and the range of non-glass contaminates that are additionally a part of the recovery system. Despite the high value the public holds for glass recycling, Glass Fines are in fact a by-product of a recovery process that enables the systemic degradation of an otherwise perfectly recyclable material. This research presents a review, designed to demonstrate ways that Glass Fines can be repurposed, recycled more effectively, or up-cycled. By matching applications for Glass Fines with waste processing and sorting techniques, realistic market contexts may be realised for this waste stream more readily by industry.

The reaction between PLA and multifunctional alcohols i.e. glycerol, sorbitol, glucose and starch were confirmed by FTIR, 1H NMR, SEC and MALDI-MS. The resulting amphiphilic products were evaluated as compatibilizer candidates for PLA/starch blends. Multiple techniques demonstrated that the obtained oligomers strengthened the interfacial adhesion and improved the compatibility and flexibility of extruded and melt-blended PLA/starch composites.

Anyway enhancements in the heat transfer technology are vital to optimize the efficiency of the process itself. This work prominences on the use of microwave irradiation as one of the most gifted heating technologies for pyrolysis, due to its ability to heat quickly and directly any microwave absorbing material. A microwave reactor was designed and fabricated using a microwave oven operating at a frequency of 2.45GHz with a variable energy output up to 5kW, quartz reactor, condensers and cold trap; this made the design appealing for any future industrial-sized microwave reactor. The optimal pyrolysis working condition led to the production of a suitable product for a fuel application. A mixture of various types of plastics is taken as samples. Carbon was used as the microwave absorbent. The pyrolyzed products (oils/waxes) were analyzed using various techniques like GCMS, FTIR and TGA.

This study tries to answer four questions: 1) whether the use of the PCE2 leads to an economic advantage over a specific life cycle of an existing building. 2) what is the biggest cost stressor in the life cycle of a PCE2? 3) the potential route for further cost optimization. and 4) how would the discount rate affect the life cycle costs, especially when Europe has entered a negative rate age? A typical apartment building in the Netherlands is selected as the case study for dynamic thermal simulation, in which the heating and cooling energy demands before and after refurbishment with PCE2 will be evaluated. By employing environmental life cycle costing (LCC), the life cycle costs over 40 years and associated strategy for cost optimization were investigated.

They were identified in this paper by a multiscale approach in the case of a lab-developed grade of pPLA obtained by the reactive extrusion of PLA with acrylated poly(ethylene glycol) (acryl-PEG) as reactive plasticizer. pPLA structure consisted of a semi-crystalline PLA matrix in which grafted poly(acryl-PEG) micro-inclusions were dispersed. Up to 5 successive processing cycles including extrusion and compression-molding, the tensile and impact properties drastically dropped indicating an embrittlement of pPLA. Structural analyses revealed that reprocessing caused these mechanisms: chain scission of PLA, crystallization of PLA, damaging of the inclusions, decrease of the size of poly(acryl-PEG) phases within the inclusions, and cracking of PLA. At the same time, the amount of grafted poly(acryl-PEG) was not influenced by the reprocessing.

Taking Malaysia as a reference, results show EE holds 16\u201319% of total energy in non-green and green-rated non-residential buildings; hence EE should not be neglected in GBCS. The material consumption phase incurs half a quarter of the total EE, indicating that major recycled and low-embodied building materials (e.g., recycled steel and green cement) should be rewarded with higher points in GBCS. Insulated building envelopes save 84\u201387% of cooling demand than non-insulated walls, with cellulose fibre insulators consuming the least EE.

Pyrolysis has advantages as all mixed plastics can be reduced back to petrochemicals. Fluidized beds have useful characteristics for energy recovery. They have an economic advantage in industrial operations due to low maintenance costs when compared to other reactors. Fluidizing beds provide flexibility in the operation that makes it possible to use various fluidizing agents and process conditions. Fluidizing beds were identified to be the best reactors for catalytic plastic pyrolysis as they provide large contact surface for the reaction to happen. The fluidizing beds have some limitations; the bed particles can erode the walls of the vessels, and the beds are sensitive to fibers, high amounts of metals, and fillers. Long-term stable operation of the fluidized bed can worsen the quality of the fluidization, and some operation conditions may cause defluidization.

As thermal treatment and recycling are common disposal methods for BFR-laden objects, it is essential to precisely describe their decomposition chemistry at elevated temperatures pertinent to their thermal recycling. Laboratory-level and pilot-scale investigations have addressed the thermal decomposition of pure BFRs and/or BFR-laden polymers under oxidative and pyrolytic environments, typically at temperatures of 280\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C. These studies shed light on the effects of various factors influencing the decomposition behaviour of BFRs such as chemical character, polymer matrix, residence time, bromine input, oxygen concentration, and temperature. Although BFRs decomposition mainly occurs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to the overall decomposition of BFRs. Exposing BFRs to temperatures higher than their melting points results in evaporation. Quantum chemical calculations have served to provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the chemical phenomena operating in decomposition of BFRs and subsequent emissions of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste incineration, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade and form brominated products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Major BPICs comprise brominated benzenes and phenols in addition to a wide range of brominated aromatics. Pyrolytic versus oxidative conditions seems to have very little influence on the thermal stability and decomposition behaviour of commonly-deployed BFRs. Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to PBDD/Fs. Experimental studies have established inventories of PBDD/F emissions with alarming high yields for many BFRs. Co-combustion of BFRs-containing objects with a chlorine source (e.g. polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of significant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (i.e. PXDD/Fs). Formation of PBDD/Fs from incomplete BFRs decomposition occurs primarily due to the condensations of gas phase precursors, including unaltered structural entities of some BFRs in their own right. Complete destruction of BFRs promotes PBDD/Fs formation via de novo synthesis. Bromination of PBDD/Fs in gas phase reactions is more prevalent if compared with chlorination mechanisms of PCDD/Fs, which is largely dominated by heterogeneous pathways. In uncontrolled burning and in simulated fly ash experiments, a strong correlation between congeners patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBDD/Fs indicate that PBDEs function as direct precursors for PBDD/Fs, even in the de novo synthesis route. In this review, we critically discuss current literature on BFRs thermal decomposition mechanisms; gather information regarding the contribution of homogenous and heterogeneous routes to overall BFRs decomposition; survey all studies pertinent to the emission of PBDD/Fs and their analogous mixed halogenated counterparts from open burning of e-waste, and finally, highlight knowledge gaps and potential directions that warrant further investigations.", "qas": [{"id": "7015", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the methods used?", "answers": [{"text": "thermal treatment", "answer_start": 136}, {"text": "thermal", "answer_start": 136}, {"text": "thermal recycling", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "thermal decomposition", "answer_start": 417}, {"text": "pyrolysis", "answer_start": 1338}, {"text": "thermal conditions", "answer_start": 1268}, {"text": "Thermal degradation", "answer_start": 1476}, {"text": "degradation", "answer_start": 1484}, {"text": "thermal stability", "answer_start": 1774}, {"text": "BFRs thermal decomposition mechanisms", "answer_start": 3013}]}]}, {"context": "The degradation processes initiated by thermo-mechanical and thermo-oxidative loading as well as exposure to ultraviolet irradiation weathering were examined in commercially available semi-crystalline polyoxymethylene (POM), using predominantly thermo-analytical methods.

(ii) Compared with before the pandemic, the national cooperation model has changed during the pandemic, and four major research centers have been formed: Central European countries centered on Italy; Nordic countries centered on United Kingdom; South Korea; Asia and Africa centered on India A developing country and a Pacific Rim country centered on United States and China. (iii) The knowledge map of keyword clustering does not change significantly before and during the COVID-19: ecosystem, spatial distribution, environmental governance and biodegradation. However, there are differences in the sub-category research of the four types of keywords. (iv) The impact of marine plastics on organisms and the governance of marine plastic pollution have become a branch of knowledge that has evolved rapidly during the pandemic.

However, in order to turn to a biological approach for coping with the ever-increasing fear of plastic aggregation and decay, the development of a methodology would be useful for posterity. To eliminate plastic wastes, two scenarios exist: produce biodegradable plastics from renewable materials or fossil fuels as building blocks, such as hydrobiodegradable/oxo-biodegradable; or find appropriate microalgae and their toxins for the development of a protocol to effectively biodegrade the plastics. Just as biodegradation of plastics is a constructive option, as they are eco-friendly with not much harm done to the environment, the development of biodegradable plastic is also equally effective. Some of the algae that are isolated from the plastic wastes are green-algae, blue-green algae, diatoms, etc. Polyethylene is basically carbon and hydrogen polymer, which is exceptionally resistant to biodegradation (less than 0.5% over 100 years), whose degradation is dependent mainly on moisture, light, and temperature. The most used types of plastics like polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene are a major threat as they are used in the manufacture of bottles, fibers, packing materials, etc. The degradation or disposal of these plastics is leading to their conversion into microsized particles which is further leading to harm to the environment, mainly when these microplastics interact with microalgae like Spirulina.

Large-scale production and applications of plastics increase their possibility of entering the environment. Previous environmental impact studies typically focused on the toxicity, behavior and fate; limited attention was paid on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. With the increase of plastic waste, the threat of plastic pollution to the earth\u2019s climate has been gradually taken seriously. Evidence showed that greenhouse gas emissions occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, including extraction and transportation of plastic raw materials, plastic manufacturing, waste treatment and entering the environment. The oil and gas industries used to make plastics are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions (from the extraction of raw materials to the manufacture of plastics). Emissions of greenhouse gases during manufacture are mainly controlled by the production facilities themselves, usually depending on the efficiency, configuration and service life of equipment. Additionally, there are some unintended impacts, including transport requirements, pipeline leakage, land use, as well as impeding forests as natural carbons sinks. Recycling of plastic waste energy seems to be a good way to deal with waste plastics, but this process will release a lot of greenhouse gases. With this energy conversion occurring, the incineration of plastic packing waste will become one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, plastics released into the environment also slowly release greenhouse gases, and the presence of (micro)plastics in the ocean will seriously interfere with the carbon fixation capacity of the ocean. In its current form, greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics will reach 1.34 gigatons per year by 2030 and 2.8 gigatons per year by 2050. This will seriously consume the global remaining carbon budgets, thereby threatening the ability of the global community to keep global temperatures rising by below 1.5 \u00b0C even 2 \u00b0C by 2100. In order to achieve this goal, the total global greenhouse gas emissions must be kept within the remaining carbon budget of 420\u2013570 gigatons. The accumulative greenhouse gas emissions from cradle to grave of plastics may exceed 56 gigatons by 2050 (approximately accounting for 10%\u201313% of the total remaining carbon budget). As the plastic industry plans to expand production on a large scale, the problem will worsen further. The World Economic Forum forecasted that by 2030, the production and use of plastics will grow at an annual rate of 3.8%, and this growth rate will fall to 3.5% per year from 2030 to 2050. However, there are significant challenges and uncertainties in this estimation, and challenge and uncertainty factors come from all aspects. Recently, several organizations and researchers have started to discern the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and plastic industrials, but relevant research on these impacts is still in its infancy. Consequently, the contribution of plastic pollution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be given immediate attention and it needs to further explore the impact of plastic pollution on greenhouse gas emission and climate change.
