0,10.1016/j.pecs.2022.101021,Pyrolysis technology for plastic waste recycling: A state-of-the-art review,"Discarded plastics can be converted to various fuels and chemicals to generate positive economic value instead of polluting the environment. In the past few years, pyrolysis has attracted much attention in the industrial and scientific communities as a promising versatile platform to convert plastic waste into valuable resources. However, it is still difficult to fine-tune an efficient and selective pyrolysis process to narrow the product distribution for a feasible commercial production. Furthermore, traditional plastic-to-fuels technology looks like another expensive way to burn fossil fuels, making no contribution to the plastic circular economy. By learning from the developed plastic-to-fuels technology, achieving the conversion of plastic waste into naphtha or plastic monomers that can be used for new plastic manufacturing in a closed-loop way is a more promising resource recovery pathway. However, there is no comprehensive review so far about achieving plastic waste recycling/upcycling by pyrolysis. This article will provide a critical review about the recovery pathways of plastic pyrolysis based on the various products (fuels, naphtha, hydrogen, and light olefins). It will overview the recent advances regarding plastic pyrolysis process and reactor design, introduce various recovery pathways based on the pyrolysis process, summarize process optimization and catalyst development, discuss the present challenges for plastic pyrolysis, highlight the importance and significance of creating a plastics’ circular economy, discuss the economic feasibility, the environmental impact, and outlook for future development for plastic pyrolysis. This review presents useful information to further develop and design an advanced pyrolysis process, with an improved efficiency, desirable product selectivity, and minimum environmental impacts. It is helpful to encourage more circular economy-oriented research aimed at converting waste plastics to naphtha and plastic monomers instead of simply producing fuels from the scientific communities of chemistry, energy, and the environment.",November 2022,Progress in Energy and Combustion Science,['naphtha'],"['Discarded plastics', 'plastic waste', 'plastic circular economy', 'naphtha plastic monomers', 'new plastic manufacturing', 'plastic waste recycling', 'plastic pyrolysis', 'plastic pyrolysis process', 'plastics’ circular economy', 'waste plastics', 'naphtha plastic monomers']","['pyrolysis', 'fine-tune efficient selective pyrolysis process', 'conversion', 'conversion', 'plastic pyrolysis', 'plastic pyrolysis process', 'pyrolysis process', 'advanced pyrolysis process']","['product distribution', 'feasible commercial production', 'naphtha plastic monomers', 'products', 'desirable product selectivity', 'naphtha plastic monomers', 'energy']"
1,10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154734,Selective recycling of BTX hydrocarbons from electronic plastic wastes using catalytic fast pyrolysis,"Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of two waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) fractions, with two different copper contents (low- and medium-grade WEEE named as LGE and MGE, respectively), were performed using micro- and lab-scale pyrolyzers. This research aimed to fundamentally study the feasibility of chemical recycling of the WEEE fractions via pyrolysis process considering molecular interactions at the interfaces of catalyst active sites and WEEE pyrolyzates which significantly influence the chemical functionality of surface intermediates and catalysis by reorganizing the pyrolyzates near catalytic active sites forming reactive surface intermediates. Hence, Al2O3, TiO2, HBeta, HZSM-5 and spent FCC catalysts were used in in-situ micro-scale pyrolysis. Results indicated that HBeta and HZSM-5 zeolites were more suitable than other catalysts for selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons and BTX. High acidity and shape selectivity of zeotype surfaces make them attractive frameworks for catalytic pyrolysis processes aiming for light hydrocarbons like BTX. Meanwhile, the ex-situ pyrolysis of LGE and MGE were carried out using HZSM-5 in micro- and lab-scale pyrolyzers to investigate the effect of pyrolysis configuration on the BTX selectivity. Although the ex-situ pyrolysis resulted in higher formation of BTX from LGE, the in-situ configuration was more efficient to produce BTX from MGE.",15 December 2022,Applied Surface Science,"['copper', 'TiO2', 'zeolites']",['waste electrical electronic equipment'],"['Non-catalytic catalytic pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis process', 'catalytic pyrolysis processes', 'ex-situ pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis configuration']",['selective production']

6,10.1016/j.psep.2022.09.072,A novel resource conversion strategy of waste plastic express packaging bags using supercritical water-ammonia process: Optimization by response surface methodology,"With the rapid development of e-commerce and express delivery industries, a large number of waste plastic express packaging bags (WPEPBs) are generated and urgent to be safely disposed. In this work, a novel resource conversion strategy was developed to produce high value-added chemicals from WPEPBs by supercritical water ammonia (SWA) process without any catalyst. WPEPBs could be converted into two parts by the SWA process: oil and solid residue. More than 80 % of the oil was identified as long-chain alkanes and alkenes due to the decomposition of polyethylene (PE) contained in WPEPBs. The presence of NH3 in SWA was beneficial to improve the production of long-chain alkenes. The plasticizers in WPEPBs including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalate ester (DEHP) could be efficiently converted into aniline (≈15%) and 2-ethylhexanol (≈4 %) due to the high reactivity of NH3 in the SWA process. Compared with the degradation of WPEPBs in supercritical water, the SWA process could reduce side effects and improve the purity of target products. High-purity CaCO3 powder could be further recovered from the solid residue. The optimal parameters of the SWA process for the conversion of WPEPBs by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were 440.5 ℃, 90 min, and CNH3 of 4.8 wt%. The conversion ratio of WPEPBs (CWPEPBs) and CaCO3 recovery ratio (RCaCO3) were 99.10 % and 98.85 %, respectively. In contrast to traditional methods for recycling of plastic waste such as mechanical recycling and incineration, the SWA process is believed to be a clean and high-efficiency resource conversion strategy for WPEPBs.",December 2022,Process Safety and Environmental Protection,"['CaCO3', 'RCaCO3']","['waste plastic express packaging bags', 'polyethylene', 'The plasticizers', 'plastic waste']","['conversion', 'novel resource conversion strategy', 'degradation', 'degradation', 'conversion', 'The conversion ratio', 'clean high-efficiency resource conversion strategy']","['high value-added chemicals', 'oil', 'oil', 'production', 'target products']"
7,10.1016/j.wasman.2021.11.009,Opportunities and challenges for the application of post-consumer plastic waste pyrolysis oils as steam cracker feedstocks: To decontaminate or not to decontaminate?,"Thermochemical recycling of plastic waste to base chemicals via pyrolysis followed by a minimal amount of upgrading and steam cracking is expected to be the dominant chemical recycling technology in the coming decade. However, there are substantial safety and operational risks when using plastic waste pyrolysis oils instead of conventional fossil-based feedstocks. This is due to the fact that plastic waste pyrolysis oils contain a vast amount of contaminants which are the main drivers for corrosion, fouling and downstream catalyst poisoning in industrial steam cracking plants. Contaminants are therefore crucial to evaluate the steam cracking feasibility of these alternative feedstocks. Indeed, current plastic waste pyrolysis oils exceed typical feedstock specifications for numerous known contaminants, e.g. nitrogen (∼1650 vs. 100 ppm max.), oxygen (∼1250 vs. 100 ppm max.), chlorine (∼1460vs. 3 ppm max.), iron (∼33 vs. 0.001 ppm max.), sodium (∼0.8 vs. 0.125 ppm max.)and calcium (∼17vs. 0.5 ppm max.). Pyrolysis oils produced from post-consumer plastic waste can only meet the current specifications set for industrial steam cracker feedstocks if they are upgraded, with hydrogen based technologies being the most effective, in combination with an effective pre-treatment of the plastic waste such as dehalogenation. Moreover, steam crackers are reliant on a stable and predictable feedstock quality and quantity representing a challenge with plastic waste being largely influenced by consumer behavior, seasonal changes and local sorting efficiencies.

9,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116490,Synthesis of zero-valent iron supported with graphite and plastic based carbon from recycling spent lithium ion batteries and its reaction mechanism with 4-chlorophenol in water,"Graphite and plastic recycled from spent lithium ion batteries were used to synthesize zero-valent iron/graphite (ZVI/G), zero-valent iron/plastic-based carbon (ZVI/P), and zero-valent iron/graphite and plastic-based carbon (ZVI/GP) with iron oxide through carbothermic reduction. The aim of preparing these catalysts is to improve the performance of ZVI in the removal of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in water through heterogeneous Fenton reactions. The structural and textural properties of materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The synthesis procedure successfully disperses ZVI particles on the synthesized materials. The combination of graphite and plastic-based carbon in ZVI/GP resulted in the best 4-CP removal performance. The degradation data fitted pseudo-first-order kinetic well. The Increase in the ZVI/GP dosage and the hydrogen peroxide concentration enhanced the 4-CP removal due to the increase in the amount of Fe2+ ions and reactive sites. Acidic pH increased the 4-CP removal percentage due to the high H+ concentration. The increase in the temperature favored the •OH formation and facilitated the 4-CP removal. The reaction energy of ZVI/GP reaches 53.54 kJ mol−1, which is competitive among the iron catalysts reported in literatures, and showing the 4-CP removal is reaction-controlled process. This study shows a promising way of recycling graphite and plastic in spent LIBs to prepare ZVI materials for wastewater treatment with the advantages of improved conductivity by graphite and added functional groups by plastic based carbon.",1 January 2023,Journal of Environmental Management,"['iron/graphite', 'graphite', 'iron', 'Graphite']","['plastic', 'graphite plastic-based carbon', 'wastewater treatment', 'plastic based carbon']",['The degradation data fitted pseudo'],['The reaction energy']

One possible way of recovering non-recyclable plastics is pyrolysis, which is considered environmentally friendly technology for obtaining fuel or chemicals from plastic waste. To tackle the challenge of recovering non-recyclable plastics via pyrolysis, it is necessary to determine their actual composition.

The addition of catalysts increased the gas yield to the detriment of the oil produced. The effect was more evident for zeolite-type catalysts, i.e., the gas yield raised from 43.3 (non-catalytic) to 51.5% (HZSM-5). Low influence on the oil composition, i.e., gasoline-range product, was detected. This can be explained by the fast deactivation of catalysts because of coke deposition. Only an increase in the fraction of gasoline in liquid oil was observed when low-cost catalysts (CaO and MgO) were used, without significant changes in the composition of this product.",December 2022,Process Safety and Environmental Protection,"['CaO', 'MgO', 'zeolite-type']","['plastic waste', 'polymer type', 'expanded polystyrene', 'high-impact polystyrene', 'polypropylene film', 'liquid oil, high-impact polystyrene', 'pyrolyzed plastic']","['pyrolysis', 'thermal catalytic pyrolysis', 'thermal']","['maximum oil production', 'expanded polystyrene', 'high-impact polystyrene', 'gasoline-range product', 'liquid oil, high-impact polystyrene', 'oil', 'i.e., gasoline-range product', 'oil composition', 'product', 'liquid oil']"

However, there is rare research for reusing pyrolysis products (carbon nanotubes). Based on pyrolysis technology of waste polypropylene (PP) plastic, carbon nanotube coated Fe–Mo/MgO nanomaterial (CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO) was prepared by chemical vapor deposition to remove Gram-pathogenic bacteria. The addition of Mo and MgO promoted the cracking of PP plastic and the formation of MWCNTs. The as-obtained CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO can stimulate H2O/O2 to produce abundant ·OH, ·O2 − and 1O2 radicals, which probably resulting from the synergistic effect of delocalization of CNTs and REDOX pair of Fe3O4. Consequently, the removal rate of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO composite catalyst can reach 100% within 2h, without the help of any additional energy or active oxidant. At the same time, the material is remarkable stability and reusability with complete removal of pathogens after six cycles.

This calls for the scaling up of the catalyst from powders into shaped catalyst bodies with both the necessary physical properties and minimal mass transport limitations. A structured catalyst of ZSM-5/SiC foam was developed in this study to address this issue. The activity and stability of 4 differently shaped ZSM-5 catalysts were evaluated in a continuous process of the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. The structured catalyst exhibited a stable selectivity to gasoline-range aromatic hydrocarbons of above 22% for 6 h under catalysis temperature of 450 °C and WHSV of 40 h−1, outperforming conventionally shaped ZSM-5 catalysts by up to 37 times. The superior stability was attributed to the enhanced mass transport associated with (1) the short diffusion path of the zeolite coating and (2) the tortuous channel geometry of the foam structure. The influence of important factors on the catalytic performance was also investigated, including coating layer thickness, ZSM-5 silica-to-alumina ratio, catalysis temperature, space velocity, and catalyst regeneration.

The properties and morphology of the catalysts were investigated. It was found that at 400 °C and a crystallization time of 18 h for support with 76.62% crystallinity, gasoline production efficiency will be 37.00%. At 500 °C and low crystallinity, the tendency of reaction to produce jet fuel with a maximum efficiency of 48.64%.

However, the relationship between the structure and activity of DESs is still ambiguous. Herein, we report an efficient 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/zinc acetate (HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2) DES catalyst for recycling waste PET based on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. First, the HTBD-OAc/ Zn(OAc)2 DES structure, in which the HTBD-OAc moiety and Zn(OAc)2 were connected through a N-H---O hydrogen bonding interaction, was clearly determined through theoretical calculations and experimental verification. Then, the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 was found to be effective for waste PET glycolysis, where the PET conversion reached 100%, and the bis(hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield reached 88.5% at 190 °C within 40 min in atmosphere. Additionally, the catalyst had high reuse performance; BHET yield remained 84.6% after the catalyst was used for over seven cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the PET glycolysis reaction mediated by the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 DES included two stages, and the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation (HTBD) played a crucial role. In the first stage, the active species [Zn]-OCH2CH2OH anion was generated through proton transfer from HTBD to OAc-, which was followed by HOCH2CH2O-H bond activation through the cooperation of HTBD and Zn. In the second stage, catalytic depolymerization of PET occurred through the cooperative functions of the Zn center and HOCH2CH2O- anion ligand.",5 July 2022,Applied Catalysis A: General,"['Zn', 'HTBD-OAc/Zn', '/Zn']","['polyethylene terephthalate', 'waste PET', 'waste PET glycolysis', 'catalytic depolymerization']","['degradation', 'catalytic degradation', 'conversion', 'PET conversion', 'glycolysis', 'waste PET glycolysis', 'PET glycolysis reaction', 'depolymerization', 'catalytic depolymerization']","['bis(hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield', 'BHET yield']"

42,10.1016/j.jaap.2022.105789,Study on the deactivation of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil,"The deactivation mechanism of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) was investigated. The accelerated deactivation experiment of catalyst was performed with model oil containing different impurities, and results indicated that the deactivation of catalyst was related to chlorides, nitrides, and sulfides in WPPO. By changing the concentration of chloride, the interactions between the three impurities were studied. Combined with the characterization results of fresh and spent catalysts, chloride was the direct cause of the deactivation of the catalyst. Chlorine atoms in chlorides were converted into HCl gas in hydrotreating, which reacted with Ni active sites, resulting in the sintering of the average Ni particle size from 52.62 nm to 139.63 nm, and the loss of Ni active components by 3–8 wt%, especially inhibiting the hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst. In addition, HCl reacted with NH3 (byproduct of nitride hydrogenation) to generate NH4Cl. The high concentration of HCl in the reaction system increased the crystallization temperature of NH4Cl from 210 °C to 294 °C, which led to the crystallization of ammonium salts in the catalyst bed. NH4Cl crystals adsorbed on the catalyst surface, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and an increase in the average pore diameter of the catalyst, which was the main reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Furthermore, based on the deactivation mechanism, several appropriate solutions were proposed.",November 2022,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,"['Ni-based', 'Ni', 'chlorides', 'chloride', 'NH4Cl', 'nitrides', 'nitride']",['waste plastic pyrolysis oil'],"['pyrolysis', 'waste plastic pyrolysis oil']","['waste plastic pyrolysis oil', 'model oil', '(byproduct']"

By modulating the catalyst properties and operating conditions, it is possible to direct the product distribution to obtain oils that may be suitable both as fuels and as chemicals. However, the efficient and safe removal of the halogens, often contained in plastic wastes, remains as a great challenge. In this work, the catalytic behaviour of ZSM-5 zeolites in the pyrolysis of a real chlorinated plastic waste of the electric and electronic equipment sector (WEEE), consisting of PE with about 3.4% of PVC, was investigated. To that end, three zeolite samples with different acidity and accessibility were synthesized and assayed. A thermal pre-treatment was applied to the plastic waste at 350 ºC, which allowed a chlorine removal of 87% from the WEEE feedstock. The pyrolysis tests were carried out in a downdraft fixed-bed stainless steel reactor, with a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 0.2, at temperatures of 600 ºC and 450 ºC in the thermal and catalytic zones, respectively, of the reaction system. In comparison with thermal pyrolysis, that mainly produced waxes, the product distribution changed considerably by contacting the pyrolysis vapours with ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to a strong enhancement in the yield of oil and gases. The largest yield of oil (about 60 wt%), having a concentration of monoaromatics (mainly BTX) above 50 wt%, was attained over the desilicated ZSM-5 sample. Regarding chlorine distribution, about 90% was accumulated in the char fraction, probably captured by the inorganic components present in the raw WEEE waste. Coke was the second fraction in terms of Cl concentration, followed by wax and oil, whereas this halogen was almost not detected in the gases. The lowest concentration of Cl in the oil was attained with the desilicated zeolite, with a value below 90 ppm, which could facilitate the subsequent processing of this stream in refinery units.",1 May 2022,Catalysis Today,"['Cl', 'zeolites', 'chlorine', 'zeolite']","['plastic wastes', 'real chlorinated plastic waste', 'plastic waste', 'raw WEEE waste']","['Catalytic pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis', 'conversion', 'conversion', 'pyrolysis', 'A thermal pre', 'thermal', 'The pyrolysis tests', 'thermal catalytic zones', 'thermal pyrolysis']","['valuable products', 'product distribution', 'oils', 'oil', 'oil']"

On other hand, face masks are made of high-quality thermoplastic polymers that could be recovered and converted into valuable products. The aim of this study is to investigate a complementary approach for the recycling of face mask in lab-scale plants: the mechanical recycling of the filter in polypropylene (PP) and the chemical recycling of the whole face mask. For this purpose, a new designed surgical face mask was chemically and physically characterized. The results shows that the face mask was composed of 92.3 wt% high grade PP (filter), very similar to virgin PP but with a high melt volume index (MVI, 385 cm3/10 min) due to its non-woven manufacturing. The PP from face mask was mixed with recycled virgin PP in order to obtain a MVI suitable for the extrusion process and recycled as filament for 3D printing. This filament was used to print a specimen with a very similar visual quality of that printed with a commercial PP filament. Simultaneously, the whole face mask underwent a pyrolysis process to produce new feedstocks or fuels. Low-cost catalysts derived from coal fly ash (CFA) were employed to enhance the production of light hydrocarbons. In particular, the synthetized acid X zeolite (HX/CFA) improved the yield of light fractions up to 91 wt% (79 wt% for thermal pyrolysis) and the quality of the light oil with the 85% of C6–C10 (55% for thermal pyrolysis).

The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C.

Converting waste plastics into high value-added hydrogen (H2) has attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported on the innovative strategy of producing highly pure (91.5 vol%) H2 from non-recyclable waste plastics through microwave-induced reactions over the iron/nickel nanoparticles supported by cerium oxide with carbon nanotube substrates (Fe/Ni-CeO2 @CNTs). The chemical structure of the catalyst was optimized, and the reaction mechanism of microwave-induced catalytic pyrolysis was also researched. The synergistic effects of dehydrogenation on Fe/Ni bimetallic particles and the reforming reaction induced by CeO2 contributed to the remarkable H2 selectivity and high H2 yield. The catalyst also showed excellent stability and robustness after 5 regeneration cycles.

However, the low yield of CNTs is one of the challenges. In this work, the addition of Mn (0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%) to Fe-based catalyst to improve the production of CNTs has been investigated. Results show that the increase of Mn content from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.% significantly promotes CNTs yield formed on the catalyst from 23.4 wt.% to 32.9 wt.%. The results show that Fe-particles in the fresh catalysts are between 10−25 nm. And the addition of Mn in the Fe-based catalyst enhanced the metal-support interactions and the dispersion of metal particles, thus leading to the improved catalytic performance in relation to filamentous carbon growth. In addition, the graphitization of CNTs is promoted with the increase of Mn content. Overall, in terms of the quantity and quality of the produced CNTs, 5 wt.% of Mn in Fe-based catalyst shows the best catalytic performance, due to the further increase of Mn content from 5 wt.% to 10 wt.% led to a dramatic decrease of purity by 10 wt.%.",15 January 2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"['Fe-based', 'Fe-particles', 'Mn']",['waste plastics'],"['Thermo-chemical conversion', 'conversion', 'chemical conversion']","['high-value products', 'production']"

DFT calculations revealed that the N orbitals had an important contribution in reducing the band gap, leading to easier hydrogen absorption and high electron transfer efficiency. Optical studies, XPS, TRES, NH3-TPD and pyridine IR further demonstrated that the amino modification promoted the visible absorption range and acidity of MIL-125 in comparison to the nitro modification, resulting in efficient catalytic degradation of chlorobenzene and toluene, even in the presence of water.

It causes serious environmental problems, such as reduced landfill space and pollution. We made WPP plastic undergo pyrolysis using a batch reactor subjected to temperatures variation of 300 °C, 350 °C, 375 °C, 400 °C, and the spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst used were 5, 7.5, and 10 wt% catalyst. We heated the reactor at a rate of 15 °C/min. until it reaches the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C at atmospheric pressure. We investigated the influence of the FCC catalyst, reaction temperatures, and catalyst to plastic ratio. We characterized the pyrolysis liquid oil using density, pour point, API gravity, flash point, viscosity, calorific value, carbon residue, ATSM distillation, and GC–MS. The thermal pyrolysis produced maximum liquid oil (83.3 wt%) with gases (13.2 wt%), and char (3.0 wt%), while the catalytic pyrolysis using 0.1 catalyst to plastic ratio decreased the liquid oil yield (77.6 wt%), and char (2.7 wt%), with an increase in gases (19.7 wt%). The GC–MS results of the catalytic pyrolysis of liquid oil showed that the liquid fractions comprised a wide range of hydrocarbon, mainly distributed within C4 to > C17. The paraffin, olefins, naphthalene, and aromatics yield were 30.83%, 44.6%. 19.44%, and 5.13%, respectively.

Meanwhile, the accumulation of waste plastic generates serious environmental pollution. Nowadays, the conversion of waste plastic into two-dimensional CNS is regarded as a promising way to address these issues due to the high carbon content of waste plastic. However, this conversion process is still impeded by low-efficient catalysts so far. Herein, the highly efficient carbonization of waste polypropylene (PP) into CNS is achieved using a combined catalyst of ferrocene and sulfur. The carbonization process in sealed space ensures an ultrahigh carbon yield (62.8%) and a thin thickness (4–4.5 nm) of as-prepared CNS, even though little catalyst is used. After activation, the activated carbon nanosheets (ACNS) show a well-defined hierarchical porous structure with a large specific surface area (3200 m2 g−1) and a big pore volume (3.71 cm3 g−1). The ACNS based electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 349 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor manifests a high energy density of 23 Wh kg−1 at 225 W kg−1.

Pyrolysis is a promising method for converting waste polymers into useful products such as aviation fuel oil, and the scientific and business communities have been attempting to commercialize it. Much work has been put into the research and development of efficient catalytic pyrolysis systems. There is, however, a significant gap in writing a cutting-edge review on the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to produce aviation fuel oil using the PRISMA technique. The objective of this study is to examine the up-to-date scientific and technological breakthroughs associated with the existing aviation fuel production paths and to identify those that may eventually lead to the construction of a sustainable supply chain fuel. This study focuses on the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to enhance aviation fuel oil production, the factors that affect the enhanced pyrolysis activity, such as process conditions, catalyst, kinetics, and mechanistic insights, as well as the technological feasibility analysis of waste plastic pyrolysis and the proposed setup for commercialization of catalytic plastic pyrolysis.

The results showed that the introduction of RM catalyst elevated gas yield from 23.8 to 60.3 wt% as a rise of catalytic temperature (700–850 °C), due to its high iron activity for scission of polymer chains. Furthermore, the endothermic nature of cracking reactions of hydrocarbons led to the maximum H2 production of 28.8 mmol g feed − 1 and 63 vol% at 850 °C. The carbon/RM nanocomposites were comprehensively evaluated by multiple characterizations. High-resolution TEM indicated considerable carbon nanotubes(CNTs) depositing on the RM surface that modified iron sites dispersion and diminished nanoparticle size of iron at higher temperature of ≥ 800 °C. XRD and XPS results confirmed that higher temperature provided carbon components surrounding iron species to form metallic iron. The carbon/RMs were initially applied to chromium(VI) removal in sewage. RM-800 delivered high-profile adsorption capacity of 193.8 mg g−1, mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of chemical reduction by sufficient Fe0 exposure and CNTs growth promoting electrostatic attraction and electron transfer capacity.

90,10.1016/j.jece.2022.108622,SolvX: Solvothermal conversion of mixed waste plastics in supercritical toluene in presence of Pd/C catalyst,"As the world's ability to cope with the fast-rising output of disposable plastic products is limited, plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most important environmental challenges. Catalytic solvothermal conversion (SolvX) could potentially utilize mixed waste plastics (MWPs) for sustainable fuels and chemical production. In this study, the effect of SolvX reaction time (1 – 5 h), Pd/C catalyst loading (0 – 10 wt%), and hydrogen loading (0–75 bar) on MWPs were investigated using supercritical toluene as solvent at temperature 350 °C. Four major waste plastics including low-density polyethylene (#4), polypropylene (#5), polystyrene (#6), and polyurethane (#7) were used as feedstock for this study. Along with SolvX conversion, the liquid products (crude oils) were characterized for elemental composition changes using ultimate analysis, boiling point distribution via thermogravimetric analysis, functional groups alteration using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and product identification via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the addition of catalyst and hydrogen have positive effects on the SolvX conversion. According to the elemental analysis, the SolvX crude oils' higher heating values (HHV) range from 32 to 38 MJ/Kg. The range of boiling points demonstrates that Pd/C increases the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. Additionally, a proposed catalytic SolvX reaction mechanism shows that the aromaticity raised with the increment of residence time and Pd/C enhances hydrodenitrogenation and deoxygenation at higher hydrogen loading.",December 2022,Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,['Pd/C'],"['disposable plastic products', 'plastic pollution', 'mixed waste plastics', 'Four major waste plastics', 'low-density polyethylene', 'polypropylene', 'polyurethane']","['Catalytic solvothermal conversion', 'conversion', 'thermal', 'SolvX conversion', 'SolvX conversion']","['disposable plastic products', 'chemical production', 'liquid products', 'product identification', 'crude oils', ""SolvX crude oils' higher heating values"", 'boiling points']"

The yields and morphologies of CNTs strongly depend on the catalyst design and reaction conditions. To boost the efficiency, tuning of bimetallic nanoparticles as catalyst is an effective approach. For that reason, A-site-deficient perovskite La0·8Ni1-xCoxO3-δ (LN1-xCx, x = 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) was developed and used as a catalyst precursor to achieve in situ formation of bimetallic Ni–Co nanoparticles. At an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio, the LN0.5C0.5 exhibited the highest yields of multi-walled CNTs, namely 840 and 853 mg/gcatalyst from high density polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. This could be attributed to the higher catalytic capability of LN0.5C0.5 catalyst for the decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon. In both cases, multi-walled CNTs had regular shapes when the reaction temperature was 700 °C. At higher reaction temperatures, the morphological changes of carbon products were observed from multi-walled CNTs to carbon nano-onions.

These rejected streams consist of many different materials (e.g., polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), aluminum, tetra-brik, and film) for which an attempt at complete separation is not technically possible or economically viable, and they are typically sent to landfills or incinerators. For this study, a simulated plastic mixture and a real waste sample from a sorting plant were pyrolyzed using a non-stirred semi-batch reactor. Red mud, a byproduct of the aluminum industry, was used as a catalyst. Despite the fact that the samples had a similar volume of material, there were noteworthy differences in the pyrolysis yields. The real waste sample resulted, after pyrolysis, in higher gas and solid yields and consequently produced less liquid.

The influences of feedstocks blending ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil and CNTs were established. The reaction mechanism of carbon deposition during the system was also probed. The results showed that co-feeding plastic to biomass siginificantly enhanced the selectivity of monoaromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from 5.6% for pure biomass to the maximum yield of 44.4% for 75.0% plastic ratio, and decreased naphthalene and its derivates from 85.9 to 41.7% correspondingly. The most synergistic effect on BTX selectivity occurred at 25% of plastic ratio. The multi-walled CNTs were successfully synethsized on Ni catalyst by utilizing prolysis gas as feedstocks. For pure biomass, the least CNTs yield with ultrafine diameters of 3.9–8.5 nm was generated via disproportionation reaction of CO which was derived from decarboxylation and decarbonylation of oxygenates on the ZSM-5 acid sites. With the rise of plastic ratio, sufficient hydrocarbons were produced for CNTs growth, endowing CNTs with long and straight tube walls, along with uniform diameters (~16 nm). The CNTs yield increased as high as 139 mg/g-cata. In addition, the decreased CO2 inhibited dry reforming with C1-C4 hydrocarbons and deposited carbon, avoiding excessive etching of CNTs. Thereby, high-purity CNTs with less defects were fabricated when plastic ratio was beyond 50% in the feedstock. The strategy is expected to improve the sustainability and economic viability of biomass pyrolysis.",15 February 2021,Waste Management,"['naphthalene', 'Ni']","['biomass/plastic wastes', 'co-feeding plastic', '75.0% plastic ratio', 'plastic ratio']","['pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis gas', 'reforming', 'biomass pyrolysis']","['aromatics-rich bio-oil carbon nanotubes', 'oil']"

The comparative catalytic activity and coke resistance for each prepared catalyst were examined in steam reforming of phenol and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. The Physico-chemical catalysts properties were characterized by N2-adsorption, XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, EDX, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, and TGA. The effects of preparation methods of NCZ nano-structure catalyst on the catalytic performances in PET-phenol steam reforming were investigated. The NCZ-hyd nanostructure catalyst exposed more outstanding catalytic activity and more excellent coke resistance in comparison with the NCZ-imp. The experimental findings exhibited that catalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method were uniform with the size of 8.8 nm, while NCZ particles prepared by conventional impregnation method were un-uniform, unshaped, and agglomerated, and the size distribution of its particles was from 25 to 50 nm.

Adapting multi-stage pyrolysis, the different chemicals were converted into industrial chemicals (benzene, toluene, styrene, etc.). To selectively convert HCs into syngas (H2 and CO), catalytic pyrolysis was adapted using supported Ni catalyst (5 wt% Ni/SiO2). Over Ni catalyst, H2 was produced as a main product due to CH bond scission of HCs. When CO2 was used as a co-reactant, HCs were further transformed to H2 and CO through the chemical reactions of CO2 with gas phase HCs. CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis also retarded catalyst deactivation inhibiting coke deposition on Ni catalyst.",1 January 2023,Chemical Engineering Journal,"['Ni/SiO2', 'Ni']","['disposable plastic food containers', 'plastic packaging waste', 'heterogeneous plastic mixture', 'polypropylene', 'polyethylene', 'polyethylene terephthalate', 'polystyrene', 'polyvinyl chloride']","['thermal', 'reliable thermal disposable platform', 'pyrolysis process', 'pyrolysis', 'multi-stage pyrolysis', 'catalytic pyrolysis', 'CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis']","['disposable plastic food containers', 'value-added hydrocarbons', 'polystyrene', 'styrene', 'main product']"

120,10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.09.016,Breakdown of plastic waste into economically valuable carbon resources: Rapid and effective chemical treatment of polyvinylchloride with the Fenton catalyst,"Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a typical non-biodegradable plastic that is resistant to chemicals, sunlight, and weathering. These properties make its disposal problematic, as items made from PVC retain their form for decades. The objective of this study is to provide an effective waste management method for the degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high-value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron(III) chloride. The iron(III)-tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono- and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton-type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites (sulfonated groups) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon-to-sulphur atom (C/S) ratio can vary from 8:1 to 29:1. The degradation efficiency, which is typically defined in terms of the bulk mass of the treated PVC plastics, was found to be greater than 98% in all cases. This also included the real samples of rigid PVC pipe. The recovered amount of the characteristic compound butanedioic acid, which is formed during the PVC plastic breakdown process, was found to consistently vary from 9.8% to 61.3% with respect to the C/S ratio. The results of this study are also helpful for the further development of similarly fast and effective plastic waste treatment and management protocols in lieu of landfill disposal, which is particularly important for polymers such as polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP).",December 2017,Polymer Degradation and Stability,['sulphur'],"['typical non-biodegradable plastic', 'effective waste management method', 'robust plastic waste', 'entire bulk polymer', 'treated PVC plastic wastes', 'polymer backbone', 'treated PVC plastics', 'PVC plastic breakdown process', 'similarly fast effective plastic waste treatment management protocols', 'polymers', 'polyethylene', 'polypropylene']","['degradation', 'degradation', 'The degradation efficiency']",['products']

The liquid product composition was highly dependent on the catalyst properties, for example, the HZSM-5 produced high aromatics, while the FCC catalyst produced high alkenes in the liquid products. The catalyst acidity and textural properties played an essential role in plastic pyrolysis within the short reaction time. This study demonstrated the feasibility of a fast, energy-efficient, and versatile plastic valorization technology based on the application of induction heating, where the plastic feed can be converted into wax, gas, and liquid products depending on the end-use applications.",January 2023,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,"['SiO2', 'zeolite', 'Al2O3']","['plastics', 'plastic pyrolysis', 'high-density polyethylene', 'low-density polyethylene', 'polypropylene', 'plastic feedstocks', 'polymer cracking', 'fast, energy-efficient, versatile plastic valorization technology', 'plastic feed']","['pyrolysis', 'biomass pyrolysis', 'plastic pyrolysis', 'thermal catalytic pyrolysis', 'thermal', 'A complete conversion', 'conversion', 'Thermal pyrolysis', 'Catalytic pyrolysis']","['high energy consumption', 'energy consumption', 'gas products', 'liquid product', 'gas products', 'The liquid product composition', 'liquid products', 'wax, gas, liquid products', 'fast, energy-efficient, versatile plastic valorization technology']"
125,10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.09.016,Breakdown of plastic waste into economically valuable carbon resources: Rapid and effective chemical treatment of polyvinylchloride with the Fenton catalyst,"Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a typical non-biodegradable plastic that is resistant to chemicals, sunlight, and weathering. These properties make its disposal problematic, as items made from PVC retain their form for decades. The objective of this study is to provide an effective waste management method for the degradation of huge amounts of the robust plastic waste. In this work, a rapid chemical treatment method has been developed by utilizing the Fenton catalyst to break down PVC plastic wastes into recoverable high-value organic compounds. During this chemical process, surface activation of PVC takes place to generate coordinating sulfonate groups that get tagged with iron(III) chloride. The iron(III)-tagged PVC is a highly active Fenton catalyst that breaks down the entire bulk polymer into a number of valued organic acids selectively using hydrogen peroxide as a green oxidant. By using this procedure, all treated PVC plastic wastes were completely degraded into water soluble organic compounds and CO2 under ambient dark conditions within 10 min. The dissolved organic compounds were identified mainly as mono- and dicarboxylic acids. The formation of these products indicates that the reaction is selective, which is not expected from the classical Fenton-type radical oxidation reactions. A detailed study was conducted to probe the possible mechanism of degradation that takes place during the chemical treatment process. It was found that the temperature conditions for PVC activation significantly affect the number of activated sites (sulfonated groups) generated on the polymer backbone, in which the carbon-to-sulphur atom (C/S) ratio can vary from 8:1 to 29:1. The degradation efficiency, which is typically defined in terms of the bulk mass of the treated PVC plastics, was found to be greater than 98% in all cases. This also included the real samples of rigid PVC pipe. The recovered amount of the characteristic compound butanedioic acid, which is formed during the PVC plastic breakdown process, was found to consistently vary from 9.8% to 61.3% with respect to the C/S ratio. The results of this study are also helpful for the further development of similarly fast and effective plastic waste treatment and management protocols in lieu of landfill disposal, which is particularly important for polymers such as polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP).",December 2017,Polymer Degradation and Stability,['sulphur'],"['typical non-biodegradable plastic', 'effective waste management method', 'robust plastic waste', 'entire bulk polymer', 'treated PVC plastic wastes', 'polymer backbone', 'treated PVC plastics', 'PVC plastic breakdown process', 'similarly fast effective plastic waste treatment management protocols', 'polymers', 'polyethylene', 'polypropylene']","['degradation', 'degradation', 'The degradation efficiency']",['products']

Both catalysts have been thoroughly characterized; the zeolite shows weak and strong acid sites and great BET surface area (412.0m2 g−1), while Red Mud contains lower acidity, with also weak and strong acid sites, meso-macropores and BET surface area of 27.49m2 g−1. Both catalysts have been tested in pyrolysis of a mixture of plastics which resembles municipal plastic wastes, at 440 and 500°C in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor. The results have been compared with those of the thermal process. It has been proved that ZSM-5 zeolite has a strong effect in the characteristics and distribution of pyrolysis products. It generates at both temperatures a greater proportion of gases and liquids with a higher content of aromatics than without catalyst. Red Mud needs higher temperatures than ZSM-5 zeolite to exert a catalytic effect in pyrolysis, since similar results to those obtained without catalyst are obtained at 440°C, while at 500°C a higher yield of gases and a greater proportion of aromatics in the liquids is obtained.",18 May 2011,Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,['zeolite'],"['plastic wastes', 'plastics', 'municipal plastic wastes']","['pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis', 'thermal', 'thermal process', 'pyrolysis products']",['pyrolysis products']

133,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122038,Selective production of aromatics from waste plastic pyrolysis by using sewage sludge derived char catalyst,"Sewage sludge char was used as the catalyst to realize the selective production of aromatics in the pyrolysis of waste mixed plastics. The effect of catalytic temperature, residence time, and plastic compositions on the product yield and distribution were investigated. The catalytic behavior of main ash components was evaluated and discussed. It was found that the selectivity of sludge char to monocyclic aromatics was up to 75.3% when catalytic temperature was 600 °C with a residence time of 1 s. The content of styrene and xylene reached 29.1% and 12.5% in oil, respectively. The selectivity of sludge char to bicyclic aromatics was up to 64.4% when the temperature was 800 °C with the same residence time of 1 s. Naphthalenes accounted for 47.5% of the pyrolysis oil. The interaction among polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene improved the selectivity of bicyclic aromatics from 46.8% to 53.7%. It can be concluded that principal ash components in sludge char could increase the aromatization degree of chain hydrocarbons and reduce the condensation degree of already formed aromatics. Acid sites (mainly aluminum phosphate) and dehydrogenation active sites (mainly -PO, sulfides, etc.) could promote the formation of aromatics by catalyzing direct dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer reaction, and Diels-Alder reaction; while ring-opening active sites (mainly calcium oxide and iron species) could prevent the formation of excessively heavy aromatics by hydrogenation and ring-opening process.",20 September 2020,Journal of Cleaner Production,"['iron', 'sulfides']","['waste mixed plastics', 'plastic compositions', 'polyethylene', 'polypropylene', 'polystyrene']","['pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis oil']","['selective production', 'product yield', 'styrene', 'oil', 'pyrolysis oil', 'polystyrene']"

Different types of multi-layer plastics such as biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP), metalized biaxial oriented polypropylene layers (MET/BOPP), poly ethylene terepthalate (PET), metalized polyethylene-terepthalate (MET/PET), PET combined polyethylene (PET/PE) and mixed polyolefin plastic wastes obtained from the municipal corporation were pyrolyzed to determine the oil, gas and char distribution. BOPP based plastic waste exhibited higher oil yield and calorific value (65–70%, 45.14 KJ/g) compared to PET based MLPs (17.8 %, 30 KJ/g) and laminated metalized plastics (13 %, 37 KJ/g). Modifying the feed composition by mixing of polyolefins-based waste plastics with PET based MLPs and BOPP/MET BOPP doubled the liquid yield and notably altered the physicochemical characterization of the resulted pyrolysis oil. Char yield in the polyolefins-based waste is observed to be lesser than the MLP based waste plastics. GC–MS analysis revealed the percentage area of hydrocarbons compounds of the pyrolysis oil obtained from PET based MLP experiments contains high fractions of medium and heavier range hydrocarbons (C11 – C20, C21 – C30). Sulfur content in the oil from different MLPs was measured as below the detection limit. Functional groups of hydrocarbons of oil were analyzed using FT-IR.

In this study, catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was performed to simultaneously improve yield and quality of gasoline-range products. NiO and HY zeolite were respectively used as in-situ and ex-situ catalysts in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis system. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis and catalysis temperatures were 500 °C and 450 °C, respectively, with 56.53 wt% oil product and 93.80% gasoline-range fraction achieved. The content of high-octane-number compounds, primarily aromatics and isomerized aliphatics, increased from 23.5% to 80.4% as HY to LDPE ratio rose from 0 to 1:5. The optimized balance between oil yield and oil quality was obtained at the HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. The presence of NiO during co-catalysis slightly decreased the oil yield by 5.3–8.5 wt%. Meanwhile, the production of aromatics was promoted obviously while the yield of normal aliphatics was inhibited, which were both favorable to improve the octane number of the oil product. The improved performance of co-catalysis could be related to the suitable hydrogen abstraction ability of NiO, which produced enormous alkenes. Subsequently, cycloalkenes and aromatics were synthesized through Diels-Alder reactions over the catalysis of HY. This co-catalysis approach in the microwave reactor provides a potentially profitable way to convert plastic waste into high-quality and high-yield gasoline fuels.",15 September 2019,Energy Conversion and Management,"['NiO', 'zeolite']","['plastic waste', 'low-density polyethylene']","['pyrolysis', 'catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis', 'two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis', 'optimum pyrolysis catalysis temperatures']","['energy saving', 'gasoline-range products', '56.53 wt% oil product', 'oil yield', 'oil quality', 'oil yield', 'production', 'oil product']"

Beauv) catalysed pyrolysis of waste plastics,"This research investigated pyrolysis as a potential method to manage plastic waste in Sichang Island, Thailand. Pyrolysis was chosen to convert waste plastic into fuel oil using Al–Si catalysts derived from cogon grass. The study consisted of three stages. The first stage determined the composition of the waste plastics found in Sichang Island. High-density polyethylene (48%) comprised the highest proportion of the waste plastics, followed by low-density polyethylene (22%), polyethylene terephthalate (13%), polypropylene (10%), and polystyrene (7%). In the second stage, the Al–Si catalysts were prepared from cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv) by treating it with acid and calcination. The optimum conditions to extract silica from cogon grass through acid treatment were heating at 700 °C for 2 h, which yielded 97.7% of amorphous silica with a surface area of 172 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.43 cc/g. This amorphous silica was combined with an aluminum precursor to form Al–Si catalysts with 20–80 wt% of Al–Si. The results showed that the surface area of the catalyst increased with increasing aluminum content. The optimum ratio was 60 wt% of Al–Si with a surface area of 200 m2/g. In the final stage, the catalytic properties of the previously prepared Al–Si catalysts in the pyrolysis of waste plastics were evaluated. The catalyst enhanced the plastic cracking process and the oil yield while decreasing the reaction time. The optimum ratio of 60% Al–Si to 10% waste plastic provided the maximum oil yield of 93.11% and the minimum reaction time of 20 min. The results showed that catalytic cracking with 60% Al–Si contributed to a high quantity of oil yield, similar to using a commercial Al–Si catalyst.

Waste-to-energy conversion is an ideal benchmark for developing future large-scale waste management technologies. The present study explores a new approach for producing energetic materials by converting inert plastic waste into energy (thermal and mechanical energies) via a light-controlled process through the simple chemical activation of plastic waste, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. The inert and non-polar polymer surfaces of the plastics were modified by generating a number of sulfonic groups (SO3 −) using chlorosulfuric acid, followed by grafting of Fe(III) catalyst onto the polymer chains to obtain activated polymer. Elemental analyses of these activated materials showed that the carbon-to-sulfur ratio ranged from 3:1 to 5:1. The FTIR spectra indicated the presence of CC bonds (v C=C: 1615–1630 cm−1) and SO bonds (v S=O: 1151–1167 cm−1) in the activated polymers after chemical reaction. These activated materials were energetic, as light could be used to convert them into thermal (1800–3200 J/g) and mechanical energies (380–560 kPa/g) using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant under ambient conditions within 1 h.",May 2018,Waste Management,"['chlorosulfuric', 'sulfur', 'sulfonic']","['unrecycled plastic waste', 'future large-scale waste management technologies', 'inert plastic waste', 'plastic waste', 'polyethylene', 'polypropylene', 'polyvinyl chloride', 'The inert non-polar polymer surfaces', 'plastics', 'polymer chains', 'activated polymer', 'activated polymers']","['conversion', 'thermal', 'thermal mechanical energies']",['energy']

152,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127396,Pyrolysis of waste oils for the production of biofuels: A critical review,"The application of waste oils as pyrolysis feedstocks to produce high-grade biofuels is receiving extensive attention, which will diversify energy supplies and address environmental challenges caused by waste oils treatment and fossil fuel combustion. Waste oils are the optimal raw materials to produce biofuels due to their high hydrogen and volatile matter content. However, traditional disposal methods such as gasification, transesterification, hydrotreating, solvent extraction, and membrane technology are difficult to achieve satisfactory effects owing to shortcomings like enormous energy demand, long process time, high operational cost, and hazardous material pollution. The usage of clean and safe pyrolysis technology can break through the current predicament. The bio-oil produced by the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high yield and HHV with great potential to replace fossil fuel, but contains a high acid value of about 120 mg KOH/g. Nevertheless, the application of CaO and NaOH can significantly decrease the acid value of bio-oil to close to zero. Additionally, the addition of coexisting bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn in particular, can simultaneously reduce the acid value and positively influence the yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, co-pyrolysis with plastic waste can effectively save energy and time, and improve bio-oil yield and quality. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the production of biofuels using conventional and advanced pyrolysis of waste oils.",15 February 2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"['CaO', 'MgO', 'Zn']","['waste oils', 'plastic waste']","['pyrolysis', 'pyrolysis feedstocks', 'clean safe pyrolysis technology', 'conventional pyrolysis', 'conventional advanced pyrolysis']","['energy supplies', 'waste oils', 'Waste oils', 'enormous energy demand', 'oil', 'energy', 'bio-oil yield', 'production']"
