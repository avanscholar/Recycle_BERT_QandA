The process started by shredding the used clothes into a powder and mix it with polypropylene-nanoclay nanocomposites. Three colors of recycled clothes were chosen which are red, blue and yellow. All samples produced from this process went to several testing such as tensile, warpage, and shrinkage. Based on the results of tensile test, the highest average Young\u2019s Modulus value with the 502.104 MPa for 3% of recycled fiber from recycled clothes. Furthermore, the Young\u2019s Modulus value for polypropylene- nanoclay without fiber was lowest as compared with other samples. The value of average shrinkage is 0.01482 mm. From the result also showed that the average warpage was 0.0332 mm. Based on the analysis, it can be assumed that the product of recycled clothes/polypropylene/nanoclay have a stable shrinkage but variation of warpage values. Hence, more focus was needed to control the warpage value to reduce this defect during manufacturing process. The outcome of this research should be beneficial in the future of plastic manufacturing process, in terms reducing cost of raw material and at the same time, the environmental pollution impact also can be reduced.

In this study, we demonstrate a simple and eco-friendly strategy to utilize the gelatin extracted from scrap skin in leather processing and prepare novel biodegradable mulch films. The gelatin chains were covalently cross-linked with tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride to reduce the hygroscopicity of gelatin. Then, polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) was introduced into the gelatin network. The hydrogen bonds between the gelatin and PVOH and several PVOH crystalline domains acted as sacrificial bonds for energy dissipation.

Such high mechanical performance is comparable to that of traditional low-density polyethylene mulch films and conforms to the GB/T 35,795 regulatory standards.

Pyrolysis is a process of converting WTs in absence of oxygen into pyrogas, fuel oil, and a by-product, which is pyrolyzed carbon black (PCB). To introduce the idea of eco-friendly and sustainable concrete, it is proposed to use PCB as an additive in concrete structures. In this experimental investigation, PCB samples are obtained from a local pyrolyzed WTs plant. Several concrete properties are investigated considering different mixes of different weight percentage ratios of PCB to cement (PCB/c); 0% (control sample), 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 7%, and 10%. Typically, fixed amounts of cement, water, sand, aggregate, and superplasticizer are prepared following international preparation standards, and then, mixed with the aforementioned PCB/c ratios. Afterward, an array of mechanical tests are performed investigating properties enhancements. These tests are slump, compressive strength, and abrasion resistance, along with water absorption. Results show a noticeable increase in the compressive strength for tested samples of 29.3 and 38.4 MPa were obtained at a ratio of 4% for 7 and 28 days, respectively. This is combined with a slight reduction of slump results; however; slump values are still within standard limits for most of the mixes. In addition, abrasion resistance results suggest a vital improvement in the PCB/c mixes. Also, water absorption measurements reflect enhancement of concrete mixes up to a specific percentage of PCB. Amongst tested PCB/c ratios, the study highlights the optimal value to be between 3% and 5%. In addition, a multi-level framework on the impact of institutional pressures on the adoption of PCB as an additive to cement has been addressed to rationalize and raise awareness towards the applicability of such a feasible approach.

To better understand the influence of SRF composition on gasification efficiency and syngas quality, two industrial SRFs having different compositions were studied. A detailed SRF characterization was performed (elemental analysis; ash composition; LHV; fraction of biomass, non-biomass, and inert materials) to precisely describe the chemical complexity of such materials. The gasification tests were performed at pilot-scale in a bubbling fluidized bed using air as gasifying agent, and olivine as bed material. The separate contribution of gasification temperature (T\u202f=\u202f750\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C) and equivalence ratio (ER\u202f=\u202f0.21\u20130.35) on the gasification efficiency was investigated by sequentially varying these two parameters. Gasification tests revealed that the LHV of the syngas and the cold gas efficiency decreased by 45\u201350% and by 20\u201330%, respectively, with rising equivalence ratio. These evolutions were attributed to syngas oxidation reactions which promoted the formation of CO2. Indeed, mass balances calculation revealed that the part of carbon atoms in syngas in the form of CO2 rises from 43 to 54% for SRF1, and from 35 to 50% for SRF2. High plastic content in SRF2 was responsible for the formation of stable light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4 and C6H6) from the decomposition of the plastic polymer chains, and to lower amount of H2 compared to syngas from biomass-rich SRF1. The carbon conversion decreased by 8% with rising ER from 0.21 to 0.30 for SRF2, as a result of plastics-biomass interactions promoting secondary reactions and leading to char formation. For both SRFs, rising temperature significantly improved the gasification efficiency whatever the SRF composition, and decreased the CO2 concentration.

The paradigm shifts from fossil fuel-based chemicals to biomass-derived products will rely on efficient and cost-effective catalysts that can compete with cheap and readily available fossil fuels. Existing transition and noble metal-based nanoparticle catalysts either in the supported or unsupported form are crippling due to poor activity/selectivity, deactivation of catalytically active sites, and the complex composition, recalcitrant nature, and high moisture content of biomass. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) possessing single-atom centers decorated on support have shown great promise in biomass conversion due to their unique geometric configuration, electronic properties, and ensemble effect. In contrast to traditional catalytic systems, SACs encompass the advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts with improved performance and easy recyclability. Because of the availability of each metal center for the reaction and unique geometrical configuration, SACs have displayed exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity (~95% in most cases). In addition, the SACs show increased thermal and chemical stability due to the stabilization of the metal center on the support.

Sweet gas was fed into the reforming process, where syngas was produced via dry reforming. Because dry reforming produced syngas with a small amount of H2, steam supplementation through a high-pressure steam generator was considered to promote steam reforming by recycling the water produced by the reverse water-gas-shift reaction or by feeding additional water. Syngas was fed into the methanol synthesis process, and the recycled cases showed higher methanol production rates than the open-loop cases despite the decreased local conversion of CO. Techno-economic analysis was performed to determine the optimal configuration to maximize profitability; the Case II-5-R (a mixture of MDEA and diethanolamine (DEA), steam supplementation of 1500 kgmole/h, recycle loop) was selected as the optimal case with a payback period of 4.24 years and return on investment of 0.173 y\u22121.
