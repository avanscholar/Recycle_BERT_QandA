The analysis of these data shows that alkaline treatment improves the properties of natural fibers in the composite.", "qas": [{"id": "607", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the process parameters values?", "answers": [{"text": "0.1944 MPa", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "0.1311 MPa", "answer_start": 1052}]}]}, {"context": "Ionic liquid (IL) is a new eco-friendly solvent to accelerate dissolution of natural polymer and several common water-soluble imidazole ionic liquids (ILs) have been selected to dissolve poultry feather and extract keratin. [Bmim]Cl has shown the best solubility, thus it has been studied to extract the keratin. Because Na2SO3 can unfold disulfide bond of polypeptide chains in different keratin molecules in feather by forming R-SSO3Na and the addition of water can increase solubility of Na2SO3 and decrease viscosity of solution, Na2SO3 and water have been used to improve the extraction process. During the solubilization process, SEM pictures show that the smooth structure of the feather was destroyed and followed by the dissolution of the keratin into the liquid phase. The keratin was easily separated from the liquid phase as a solid precipitate after adding some more water owing to the miscibility of the IL with water and the immiscibility of the keratin with water. The keratin precipitate was filtrated and the liquid was distilled to remove water, then the IL and Na2SO3 can be recycled. The optimum extraction conditions for keratin are: 20wt.% of water in IL\u2013water, 10wt.% Na2SO3 in liquid phase, the weight ratio of liquid/feather=20, extraction temperature at 90\u00b0C, and extraction time of 60min; under these conditions, the dissolution rate of feather is 96.7% and the yield of keratin is 75.1%.", "qas": [{"id": "608", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the process parameters values?", "answers": [{"text": "90\u00b0C ,", "answer_start": 1416}]}]}, {"context": "In this work, the influence of pressure on specific coal throughput and particle behavior was investigated. Firstly, mono-gasification of Jincheng anthracite (JCA) and meat and bone meal (MBM) and co-gasification of JCA and MBM were performed in pressurized fluidized bed gasifier pilot plant with a pressure of 0.1\u20132.6\u202fMPa and a temperature of 900\u20131050\u202f\u00b0C (mono-gasification of MBM at about 750\u202f\u00b0C). It was found that the specific coal throughput is approximately directly proportional to the pressure to the power of 0.6\u20130.75 and co-gasification leads to successful thermochemical conversion of JCA as opposed to mono-gasification. Furthermore, a series of experiments, in a Pseudo-2D cold mode of a pressurized fluidized bed gasifier using an optic fiber probe system, have been performed to investigate the effects of pressure, fluidizing-gas velocity and static bed height on the particle behavior. The bed material used in this study was polystyrene having average diameter of 1.32\u202fmm. It was found that the effect of pressure on vertical local-particle velocities ( V p ) at low bed height (LBH) can be ignored at identical excess fluidizing-gas velocity while V p at high bed height (HBH) decrease slightly with pressure in the lower pressure range (evidently below approximately 1.2\u202fMPa) and increase thereafter. The effects of the fluidizing-gas velocity on V p at LBH and HBH are also different. However, the effects of static bed height on V p both at LBH and HBH are the same under pressure.", "qas": [{"id": "609", "is_impossible": false, "question": "What are the process parameters values?", "answers": [{"text": "0.1\u20132.6 MPa", "answer_start": 1504}, {"text": "1.2 MPa", "answer_start": 1504}]}]}, {"context": "The oxidative depolymerization of alkali lignin (AL) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2C1im]OAc) system without additional catalyst was investigated under mild conditions (initial O2 pressure of 1.5 MPa, 80 \u00b0C\u2013100 \u00b0C). Compared with other ionic liquids (ILs), the cooperation of imidazolium cation and acetate anion successfully enhanced AL conversion. Among the investigated imidazolium acetate ILs with ethyl- to octyl-side chains, [C2C1im]OAc presented the best catalytic capacity for AL oxidative depolymerization. Adding an appropriate amount of water to [C2C1im]OAc can further improve the reaction efficiency. In the [C2C1im]OAc system with the addition of 0.10\u20130.25 mL of water, approximately 77 wt% AL was depolymerized into small molecule soluble products at 100 \u00b0C for 2 h.
